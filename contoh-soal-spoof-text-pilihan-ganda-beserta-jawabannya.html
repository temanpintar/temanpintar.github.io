                        The Blonde and the Lawyer

A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY.
The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game.
The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.
The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.
He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."
Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."
This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."
She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you", and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

Hanya saja, anecdote text lebih merujuk pada teks tentang kejadian ganjil atau tidak umum—yang tidak selalu berupa humor; sedangkan spoof texs khusus menceritakan kisah-kisah lucu.<br /><br />Generic structure dari keduanya pun berbeda pula. Dalam spoof text, ada Orientation, Event, dan Twist.<br /><br />Orientation adalah bagian pembuka yang berisi pengenalan tokoh, latar, setting dan sebagainya; kemudian Event menyebutkan kejadian atau peristiwa inti; lalu Twist adalah ending atau penutup atau akhir yang lucu dari cerita tersebut.<br /><br />Dibutuhkan selera humor yang baik untuk bisa menangkap kelucuan dari twist yang dibaca, khususnya sebab perbedaan budaya yang kita miliki dengan si penulis teks.<br /><br />Agar lebih mengerti tentang apa itu spoof text, simak beberapa contoh yang tersebar di internet yang sudah dilengkapi dengan terjemahannya di bawah ini.<br /><br /><br />Old Man and The Bus<br /><br />One day an old man stood up on a bus halt. He looked waiting something. Then he asked to a young man near him, “Excuse me, what time is the bus to Bandung?”<br /><br />“5 minutes later,” the young man answered. “What about the bus to Semarang?” the old man asked again. “Around 10 minutes later,” the young man answered briefly. “Where are you going to go, Sir?”<br /><br />“I just wanna cross this street. I’m afraid they hit me,” the old man answered then walked crossing the street.<br /><br />Lelaki Tua dan Bus<br /><br />Suatu hari seorang lelaki tua berdiri di halte bus. Dia tampak sedang menunggu sesuatu. Kemudian, dia bertanya pada pemuda di dekatnya. “Permisi, jam berapakah jadwal bus ke Bandung?”<br /><br />“Lima menit lagi,” jawab si pemuda. “Bagaimana dengan bus ke Semarang?” tanya lelaki tua lagi. “Sekitar 10 menit lagi,” jawab si pemuda dengan singkat. “Kemana anda hendak pergi, Pak?”<br /><br />“Aku hanya ingin menyeberangi jalan ini. Aku takut bus itu menabrakku,” ujar lelaki tua kemudian melangkah menyeberangi jalan.<br /><br />===<br /><br /><br />“Honey What is for Supper?”<br /><br />An elderly gentleman of 85 feared his wife was getting hard of hearing. So one day he called her doctor to make an appointment to have her hearing checked.<br /><br />The Doctor made an appointment for a hearing test in two weeks, and meanwhile there’s a simple informal test the husband could do to give the doctor some idea of the state of her problem.<br /><br />“Here’s what you do,” said the doctor. “Start out about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on until you get a response.”<br /><br />That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he’s in the living room. He tries to ask, “Honey, what’s for supper?”<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />So the husband moved to the other end of the room, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, “Honey, what’s for supper?”<br /><br />Still no response.<br /><br />Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, “Honey, what’s for supper?”<br /><br />Again he gets no response.<br /><br />So he walks up to the kitchen door, only 10 feet away. “Honey, what’s for supper?”<br /><br />Again there is no response.<br /><br />So he walks right up behind her. “Honey, what’s for supper?”<br /><br />“Jesus Earl, for the fifth time: CHICKEN!”<br /><br />“Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />Seorang lelaki tua berusia 85 tahun khawatir istrinya semakin sulit mendengar. Maka suatu hari, dia memanggil dokter istrinya untuk membuat janji periksa. Dokter membuat janji untuk tes pendengaran dalam dua minggu, dan sementara itu ada tes informal sederhana yang dapat dilakukan oleh sang suami untuk memberi dokter beberapa gagasan tentang keadaan masalah istrinya.<br /><br />“Inilah yang harus Anda lakukan,” kata dokter. “Mulailah sekitar 40 kaki darinya, dan dalam nada bicara percakapan normal, lihat apakah dia bisa mendengar Anda. Jika tidak, coba dalam jarak 30 kaki, lalu 20 kaki, dan seterusnya sampai Anda mendapat jawaban. ”<br /><br />Malam itu, sang istri sedang memasak makan malam di dapur, dan dia ada di ruang tamu. Dia bertanya, “Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />Tidak ada respon.<br /><br />Maka, sang suami pindah ke ujung ruangan yang lain, sekitar 30 kaki dari istrinya dan mengulangi, “Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />Masih tidak ada jawaban.<br /><br />Selanjutnya dia pindah ke ruang makan di mana dia sekitar 20 kaki dari istrinya dan bertanya, “Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />Sekali lagi dia tidak mendapat jawaban.<br /><br />Jadi dia berjalan ke pintu dapur, hanya berjarak 10 kaki. “Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />Sekali lagi tidak ada jawaban.<br /><br />Maka dia pun berjalan tepat di belakang istrinya. “Sayang, apa makan malamnya?”<br /><br />“Ya Tuhan Earl, untuk kelima kalinya: <p>1.

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

                        SMS Spoofing occurs when a sender manipulates address information. Often it is done in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network. Frequently, these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network – with the home SMSC essentially being “hijacked” to send messages into other networks.The impact of this activity is threefold:The home network can incur termination charges caused by the delivery of these messages to interconnect partners.These messages can be of concern to interconnect partners. Their customers may complain about being spammed, or the content of the messages may be politically sensitive. Interconnect partners may threaten to cut off the home network unless a remedy is implemented. Home subscribers will be unable to send messages into these networks.While fraudsters normally used spoofed-identities to send messages, there is a risk that these identities may match those of real home subscribers. The risk therefore emerges, that genuine subscribers may be billed for roaming messages they did not send. If this situation occurs, the integrity of the home operator’s billing process may be compromised, with potentially huge impact on the brand.<br />

 the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with 
four legs?" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and

                        My Favourite Movie<br /><br />My favorite movie is “Monters, Inc.” It is my favorite because it’s funny, the characters are colorful and it has a good story.<br /><br />“Monsters, inc.” characters are Sully, Mike, Boo, and Randall. Sully is like King Kong or gorilla. He is fat, blue and has a lot of fur. He has big teeth. Mike is Sully’s friend. They work together. Mike is small, green and has tiny hands and feet. Most important he has one big eye. Boo is a human, not a monster. She gets into the Monster city by accident.<br /><br />Boo is about two years old. She’s short, cute with black hair in pony tails. Finnaly, theres is Randall. He is the bad guy (villain). He looks just like a lizard. He can also disappear. In the movie Sully and Mike are roommates and work together in an energy company. Their job is to scare the kids. Screaming makes energy to run the city. Sully went into Boo’s room and Boo excaped into Monsterr City. That was a problem becuas monsters think humans are poison. Sully and Mike try to hide Boo because they don’t want to get in trouble. The two friends try to protect her and send her back home.<br /><br />This movie made me feel happy. I was laughing the whole. For example, when baby Boo laughed and giggled, I laughed. Also, when Boo cried, the monster Mike made her laugh by umping and pulling on his eye. Another thing that happened and that when Sully put her down, she would run away and hide. The thing that made me happiest is after all her troubles she finally got back home. There were so many things that were funny I laughed all the time.<br /><br />good luck <br />

                        Text spoof itu di gambarkan sebagai teks narasi yg bersumber dari kejadian faktual di masa lampau dengan tujuan menghibur pendengar/pembaca.<br /><br />contoh:<br /> penguin in the park<br />once a man was walking in the park  when he came across a penguin. He took him to a policeman and said, " I have just found this penguin. what should i do ?" the policeman replied,'take him to the zoo'.<br /><br />the next day day the policeman saw the same man in the same park and the man was still carrying the penguin with him. The policeman was rather surprised and walked up to the man and asked, 'why are you still carrying that penguin about ? didn't you take it to the zoo ? 'I certainly did', replied the man' and it was a great idea because he really enjoyed it, so today I'm taking him to the moviestSpoof text adalah salah satu jenis teks yang dianggap paling menyenangkan untuk dipelajari. Dengan adanya Spoof text, setidaknya siswa yang selalu cemberut saat belajar bahasa Inggris bisa terobati. Coba tanyakan pada kawan anda, adakah siswa yang “sangat membenci” pelajaran bahasa Inggris? Saya pastikan, “ADA”. Lah, seorang Nabi saja banyak yang benci, apalagi sebatas bahasa Inggris.Namun, dengan hadirnya materi belajar spoof text ini, semoga saja berangsur-angsur kebencian ini bisa berganti menjadi rasa cinta.<br />Spoof text adalah salah satu jenis teks bahasa Inggris yang isinya mengenai cerita lucu. Siapa sih yang tidak tersenyum jika ada hal yang bersifat lucu? Orang stress aja kali ya? Jika narrative text cenderung menceritakan suatu kisah dengan berbagai permasalahan yang harus dipecahkan; dan jika recount text lebih condong menceritakan kegiatan seseorang dalam urutan waktu tertentu, spoof text masih berbeda dengan dengan kedua teks tersebut. Apa sih?Untuk lebih jelasnya, mari pelajari daftar isi pelajaran spoof text di bawah ini :Pengertian / Definisi Spoof Text<br />Generic Structure of Spoof Text<br />Contoh Spoof Text – Absence<br />Contoh Spoof Text – Sam Ting WongDEFINISI SPOOF TEXTDisebutkan dalam Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary Online, ada dua makna spoof. Pertama, sebagai kata benda, spoof bermakna, “a funny and silly piece of writing, music, theatre, etc. that copies the style of an original work”. Sedang kedua, spoof sebagai kata kerja, bermakna, “to try to make someone believe in something that is not true, as a joke.”<br />Dari kedua arti spoof di atas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa pengertian spoof text adalah sebuah teks yang berisi tentang humor meski sebagian teksnya sudah dimodifikasi dari aslinya.GENERIC STRUCTURE OF SPOOF TEXTGeneric Structure (Susunan umum) dalam spoof text adalah :Orientation, berisi pengenalan tokoh, latar, setting dll.<br />Events, berisi peristiwa atau kejadian<br />Twist, ending cerita (akhir cerita yang dianggap lucu, kadang tidak terduga)spoof, spoof text, contoh spoof text, spoof text examplesPenjelasan mengenai orientation dan event sudah sering dibahas, khususnya pada pelajaran narrative text dan recount text. Dalam spoof text pun, orientation dan event tidak jauh berbeda dengan yang ada dalam narrative dan recount.<br />Sedang untuk twist, bagi seorang yang belum terbiasa menulis cerita lucu mungkin sangat sulit; untuk memahami twist saja sudah sulit, apalagi mengarang sendiri…Ya, untuk memahami twist, kita membutuhkan selera humor tinggi hingga kita mampu mencerna apa dibalik kelucuan yang terkandung dalam twist ini. Sebab biasanya sangat sulit memperkirakan, “apa sih bagian lucunya?”CONTOH SPOOF TEXT : ABSENCEJoe’s Mother got angry because her son got a low mark on English test.“Why did you get such a low mark on that test?” Asked mother angrily. Asked by his angry mother, Joe just kept silent and went out.A few moment, Joe came back home and met his mother again. His mother asked the same question.Joe answered steadily, “Because of absence.”“You mean you were absent on the day of the test?” Mother wondered.Joe replied, “No, but the kid who sits next to me was.”CONTOH SPOOF TEXT : SAM TING WONGJacky Wong got married with Lia Wong. Both of them had a white skin and straight hair. They are really a well-matched couple.One year later, Wong family got a new baby. A nurse brought them a son with curly hair and a black skin.The nurse congratulated and said, “What name will you give to this son?”With a confused face, Jacky Wong grumbled, “Sam Ting Wong!”<br />
