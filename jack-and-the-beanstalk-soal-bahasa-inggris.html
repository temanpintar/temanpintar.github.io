                                            Jack and The Beenstalk
Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!” She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.
While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, 
he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.
Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” The giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him.
After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.
The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.
Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.

                                            *Jack and the beanstalk*Once upon a time there was a poor widow who had an only son named Jack. They were so poor that they didn’t have anything except a cow. When the cow had grown too old, his mother sent Jack to the market to sell it. On the way to the market, Jack met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. The butcher told the boy that the beans were of great value and persuaded the silly fad to sell the cow for the beans.Jack brought them happily. When he told his mother about this, his mother became so angry that she threw the beans out of the window.When Jack woke up in the morning, he felt the sun shining into a part of his room but all the rest was quite dark and shady.So he jumped to the window. What did he see? The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack’s window. He opened the window and jumped to the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder.He climbed … and climbed till at last he reached the sky. While looking around, he saw a very huge castle.

                                            Jack and his mother were hungry. The cow in the barn gave themmilk, but they needed food. Jack's mother said, we must sell the cow toget some food. Jack volunteered to take the cow to town. Along theway. Jack met a farmer who talked him into giving up the cow inexchange for a handful of good luck beans.When Jack returned home, his mother was very cross becausethey lost their cow for a few beans. She threw the beans out thewindow and went to bed. The beans began to grow straight up into thesky, so Jack climbed the beanstalk hoping to find good luck at the top.Instead, he found himself in a giant's castle. The giant wascounting his money and singing, I like children in my tum. The giant'swife helped Jack hide so the giant wouldn't eat him. Then Jack realizedsomething and said, "Hey, this giant stole my father's money!" Thegiant's wife said, “This magic hen and golden harp used to belong toyour father too. Play the harp, and then run!"Jack played the harp, and the giant fell asleep. Jack grabbed themoney and the hen and started running. But on the way outside, heknocked over the harp and woke the giant up. The giant chased Jack allthe way down the beanstalk. When Jack reached the bottom, hechopped down the beanstalk with an ax. The giant was no more. Thenthe magic hen clucked and laid a golden egg. Jack's mother, awakenedby all the noise. She took the golden egg, put it with the money, andsaid, "now we'll have something nice to eat."Ka tolong bantu Terjemahin ke bahasa Indonesia ​</a>

                                            TEXT 5 THE JACK STORIES (Folklore)
‒‒‒‒
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He lived with his
mother. They were very poor. Jack's mother told him to sell the cow and
to use the money to buy food. Jack sold the cow and got the money.
But he spent the money on some magic beans. Jack's mother was
really mad at him. But he stayed cheerful. He planted the magic beans
and soon had a beanstalk growing up to the sky. Up the beanstalk he
went. He found a rich giant. He stole the giant's money. Back on the
ground, he cut down the beanstalk and the giant was killed, Jack and
his mother lived happily ever after.
You know all about Jack and the Beanstalk. This story is one of a large
body of folk tales about Jack. The Scots-Irish settlers brought the Jack Stories
from Scotland to Ireland to the United States as they migrated over a long
period of time. You can still hear some of the Jack stories if you can find an
old storyteller in the outback of the Appalachian Mountains.

and the beanstalk 
Once
upon a time there was a poor widow who had an only son named Jack. They were so
poor that they didn't have anything except a cow. When the cow had grown too
old, his mother sent Jack to the market to sell it. On the way to the market,
Jack met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. The butcher told
the boy that the beans were of great value and persuaded the silly fad to sell
the cow for the beans.
Jack
brought them happily. When he told his mother about this, his mother became so
angry that she threw the beans out of the window.
When
Jack woke up in the morning, he felt the sun shining into a part of his room
but all the rest was quite dark and shady.
So
he jumped to the window. What did he see? The beanstalk grew up quite close
past Jack’s window. He opened the window and jumped to the beanstalk which ran
up just like a big ladder.
He
climbed … and climbed till at last he reached the sky. While looking around, he
saw a very huge castle. He was very amazed.
Then
Jack walked along the path leading to the castle. There was a big tall woman on
the doorstep. Jack greeted her and asked for the giantess mercy to give him
breakfast, because he felt very hungry. Although the giantess grumbled at
first, finally she gave Jack a hunk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk.
Jack
hadn’t finished when the whole house, began to tremble with the noise of
someone’s coming. “Oh! It’s my husband!” cried the giantess. “What on earth
shall I do?”Hastily
the giantess opened a very big cupboard and hid Jack there.</a>

                            8. Jack and The Beenstalk
Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!” She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.
While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, 
he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.
Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” The giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him.
After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.
The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.
Jack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.

                                                         lazy jack<br />dalam b.inggris<br />Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman got her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His mother could not get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to get his living as he could.<br /><br />This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day to a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook. "You stupid boy," said his mother, "you should have put it in your pocket." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.<br /><br />On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper, who gave him a jar of milk for his day’s work. Jack took the jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got home. "Dear me!" said the old woman; "you should have carried it on your head." "I’ll do so another time," said Jack.<br /><br />So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took the cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the cheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with his hair. "You stupid lout," said his mother, "you should have carried it very carefully in your hands." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.<br /><br />On Friday, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack took the cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go. When he got home, his mother said to him, "You silly fellow, you should have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you." "I’ll do so another time," said Jack.<br /><br />So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton, tied it to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt. His mother was this time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was Sunday, and she was obliged to make do with cabbage for her dinner. "You ninney-hammer," said she to her son; "you should have carried it on your shoulder." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.<br /><br />On the next Monday, Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Jack found it hard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and began walking slowly home with his prize. Now it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, but deaf and dumb. Now she had never laughed in her life, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her laugh. This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered her speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his promise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich gentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack’s mother lived with them in great happiness until she died.<br />

When the cow had grown too old, his mother sent Jack to the market to sell it. On the way to the market, Jack met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. The butcher told the boy that the beans were of great value and persuaded the silly fad to sell the cow for the beans.Jack brought them happily. When he told his mother about this, his mother became so angry that she threw the beans out of the window.When Jack woke up in the morning, he felt the sun shining into a part of his room but all the rest was quite dark and shady.So he jumped to the window. What did he see? The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack’s window. He opened the window and jumped to the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder.He climbed … and climbed till at last he reached the sky. While looking around, he saw a very huge castle. He was very amazed.Then Jack walked along the path leading to the castle. There was a big tall woman on the doorstep.

But he spent the money on some magic beans. Jack's mother was
really mad at him. But he stayed cheerful. He planted the magic beans
and soon had a beanstalk growing up to the sky. Up the beanstalk he
went. He found a rich giant. He stole the giant's money. Back on the
ground, he cut down the beanstalk and the giant was killed, Jack and
his mother lived happily ever after.
You know all about Jack and the Beanstalk. This story is one of a large
body of folk tales about Jack. The Scots-Irish settlers brought the Jack Stories
from Scotland to Ireland to the United States as they migrated over a long
period of time. You can still hear some of the Jack stories if you can find an
old storyteller in the outback of the Appalachian Mountains.

and the beanstalk 
Once
upon a time there was a poor widow who had an only son named Jack. They were so
poor that they didn't have anything except a cow. When the cow had grown too
old, his mother sent Jack to the market to sell it. On the way to the market,
Jack met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. The butcher told
the boy that the beans were of great value and persuaded the silly fad to sell
the cow for the beans.
Jack
brought them happily. When he told his mother about this, his mother became so
angry that she threw the beans out of the window.
When
Jack woke up in the morning, he felt the sun shining into a part of his room
but all the rest was quite dark and shady.
So
he jumped to the window. What did he see? The beanstalk grew up quite close
past Jack’s window. He opened the window and jumped to the beanstalk which ran
up just like a big ladder.
He
climbed … and climbed till at last he reached the sky. While looking around, he
saw a very huge castle. He was very amazed.
Then
Jack walked along the path leading to the castle. There was a big tall woman on
the doorstep. Jack greeted her and asked for the giantess mercy to give him
breakfast, because he felt very hungry. Although the giantess grumbled at
first, finally she gave Jack a hunk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk.
Jack
hadn’t finished when the whole house, began to tremble with the noise of
someone’s coming. “Oh! It’s my husband!” cried the giantess. “What on earth
shall I do?”Hastily
the giantess opened a very big cupboard and hid Jack there.</h2><br />
