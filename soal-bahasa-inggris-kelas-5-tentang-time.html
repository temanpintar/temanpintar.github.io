I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel.I went to the beach near hotel in the afternoon. I was too tired and relaxed on the beach. I saw beautiful beach with clear waters and white sand. It was wonderful landscapes, lovely coastal villages, it was fantastic. One day I took a ship to Formentera. Sailing by ship was great. When I got to Formentera, I rented a motorbike to visit the island. Formentera is a small lovely island. I could see wonderful beach, sand dunes, and great landscapes.It was summer and there were many people there. I didn’t go out at the night except the last day. I went to a disco in Ibiza near Ambosa Beach. It was a big disco but expensive. I spent much money there but I had a good time. I was too tired. I went to the bed latetly.
