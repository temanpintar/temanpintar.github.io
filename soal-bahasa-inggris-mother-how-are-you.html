Cinderella                Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Cinderella. She lived with her step mother and two step sisters. The step mother and her two daughters didn't like Cinderella. They treated Cinderella very bad. Cinderella usually did the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family, and so on. Cinderella One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the Prince's spouse. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her step mother asked her to stay at home and do the house works. Cinderella cried. Then there was a fairy godmother standing beside her. "Why are you crying, Cinderella?", the fairy godmother asked. "Because I want to go to the ball but my step mother insists me to stay at home. Besides, I don't have any beautiful dress" said Cinderella. Then the fairy turned Cinderella's ugly dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and the mice become six white horses. Cinderella finally could go to the ball but she had to come back before midnight before the spell ended. At the ball, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the Prince. The Prince asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight. Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to go home. But she lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The Prince picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. A few days later, the Prince proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the King's solder let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly. Finally, she was driven to the palace. The Prince was overjoyed to see her again. They were married and live happily ever after.soal nya ada di gambar ​</a>

It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia.

                                            Hello everyone, how are you today? hopefully you are always fine.Pada kesempatan ini kami akan memberikan materi penggunaan to be dalam bahasa inggris. Materi ini ditujukan khususnya untuk siswa kelas 7 SMP. To be terdiri dari am, is, are sedangkan was dan were merupakan bentuk lampau-nya. Banyak yang mengartikan to be ini sebagai 'adalah' namun nyatanya to be ini tidak di artikan dalam bahasa indonesia. Perlu diingat bahwa to be itu digunakan sebagai penghubung antara subjek dan predikat, jadi tidak ada artinya atau bisa juga disebut sebagai kata bantu dari sebuah kalimat. Mari kita simak penjelasannya dalam point-point berikut ini.Pengertian To Be ( AM / IS / ARE ) ( WAS / WERE )Am = Dipakai untuk orang pertama, berpasangan dengan ' I Is = Dipakai untuk orang ketiga tunggal, berpasangan dengan 'He, She, It'Are = Dipakai untuk menunjukkan orang yang lebih dari satu (jamak) dan orang kedua berpasangan dengan 'You, We, They'Sedangkan was dan were digunakan untuk bentuk lampau atau simple past tense.Was = Merupakan bentuk lampau dari am dan is, berpasangan dengan 'I, He, She, It'Were = Merupakan bentuk lampau dari are, berpasangan dengan 'You, We, They'Baca juga: Penggunaan Subject I, You, They We, He, She, dan It beserta Soal LatihannyaPenggunaan To beSeperti yang kami jelaskan di atas, to be digunakan sebagai penghubung antara subjek dan predikat. Nah predikat ini dapat berupa, Adjective, Adverb, Noun, dan Verb-Ing.To be + AdjectiveAdjective merupakan kata yang menunjukan sifat dari subjek atau objek. Contoh kalimat to be + adjective adalah sebagai berikut.&gt; I am Happy (aku senang)&gt; She is pretty (dia cantik)&gt; That cat is cute (kucing itu lucu)&gt; Theu are all kind (mereka semua baik)&gt; You are diligent (kamu rajin)To be + Adverb.   Adverb merupakan kata yang menerangkan tempat dan waktu kejadian terjadi. Contoh kalimat to be + adverb adalah sebagai berikut.&gt; I am at home (aku ada di rumah)&gt; My sister is in the cinema (kakakku sedang ada di bioskop)&gt; Fish is in the water (ikan berada di dalam air)&gt; We are in the swimming pool (kami ada di kolam renang)&gt; They are not in their room (mereka tidak berada di ruangan mereka)To be + NounNoun merupakan kata benda yang menunjukkan sebuah benda, hal, binatang, profesi dan lain sebagainya yang ada di sekitar kita. Contoh kalimat to be + noun adalah sebagai berikut:&gt; I am a writer (aku adalah seorang penulis)&gt; They are students (mereka adalah siswa)&gt; You are a good football player (kamu adalah pemain sepak bola yang bagus)&gt; She is a dentist (dia adalah seorang dokter gigi)&gt; It is a book (itu adalah sebuah buku)&gt; It is a table (itu adalah sebuah meja)To be + Verb-ingTo be + verb-ing ini merupakan salah satu rumus dari Present Continuous Tense yang digunakan untuk menyatakan sebuah aktifitas yang masih berlangsung atau sedang di lakukan. Contoh kalimat to be + verb-ing adalah sebagai berikut.&gt; I am studying english (aku belajar bahasa inggris)&gt; My mother is cooking (ibuku sedang memasak)&gt; My father is fishing (ayahku sedang memancing)&gt; They are playing chess (mereka sedang bermain catur)&gt; We are reading the same book (kami sedang membaca buku yang sama)Penggunaan kalimat diatas merupakan bentuk present, namun jika konteks waktunya ada di masa lalu atau lampau tinggal di ubah to be-nya menjadi was/were&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;Exercise :Buatlah masing2 5 contoh lain dari pembahasan yg telah bapak jelaskan diatas dibuku latihan kalian, photo lalu Share ke ketua kelas kalian masing2.​</a>

Cinderella One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the Prince's spouse. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her step mother asked her to stay at home and do the house works. Cinderella cried. Then there was a fairy godmother standing beside her. "Why are you crying, Cinderella?", the fairy godmother asked. "Because I want to go to the ball but my step mother insists me to stay at home. Besides, I don't have any beautiful dress" said Cinderella. Then the fairy turned Cinderella's ugly dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and the mice become six white horses. Cinderella finally could go to the ball but she had to come back before midnight before the spell ended. At the ball, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the Prince. The Prince asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight. Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to go home. But she lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The Prince picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. A few days later, the Prince proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the King's solder let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly. Finally, she was driven to the palace. The Prince was overjoyed to see her again.

Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs?

This text below is for question 5 – 8 
 I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mum called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mum called me again. That snooze made me late.
 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
 After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stairs. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.
