                                            Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry. Then she saw a little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs.
The dwarfs said, “What is your name?”
Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”
Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.
The dwarfs said, “If you want, you may live here with us.”
Snow White answered, “Oh, could I? Thank you.”
Finally, Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.

                                            Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish –a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphorical is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is perpasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentaly metaphorical in nature.The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to mundane details. Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we experience, and what we do everyday is very much a matter of metaphor.But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do everyday, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting, language is an important source of evidence for what the system like. Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence, we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature. Shortly, to give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such concept to structure an everyday activity, let us see the concept ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety expressions, such as; Your claims are indefensible, He attacked every weakpoint in my argument, His criticisms were right on target, I’ve never won an argument with him, You disagree, okay, shoot!, and the like.(Source: Metaphors We Live by, George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson, 2003: 11)Find the meaning of the following words or phrase based on the above text!1. metaphor:..........................................................................................................2. conceptual system:........................................................................................3. mundane:..........................................................................................​</a>

Crisis : provide       the outlook appeared to be bleak for procter and gamble. however
details of the         , at this time, it seemed that destiny played a dramatic part in pulling the 
unusual incident     struggling company from the clutches of bankruptcy- a forgetful employee
                            at small factory in cincinnati forgot to turn off his machine when he want 
                            out to lunch. the result ? a frothing mass of lather filled with air bubbles.
                           he almost threw the stuff a way but decided to make it into soap instead.
                             the soap floated. this, ivory soap was born and became the mainstay of 
                           the procter and gamble

reaction to crises    company. why was soap that floats became such a hot item at the time?
                             in cincinnati, during that preriod, some people bathed in the ohio river. 
                            floating soap would never sink and consequently never got lost. so, ivory 
                            soap became a best seller in ohio and eventually across the country also.
Code : reflection     like procter and gamble, never give up when go wrong or when seemingly

                                            Read the passage.
Vegetarianism has become the most popular diet among the young generations facing the new millennium. This discipline eliminates the intake of meat and in some cases also the consumption of dairy products and eggs. Are there enough reasons to make you change your eating habits? My purpose is to prove that vegetarianism is the diet that offers more benefits to our health, spirit, and society.
Nowadays, health is the number one individual and governmental concern. Health is a fragile factor and its behavior relies mostly on the nutritional quality of the food we ingest. A balanced non-vegetarian diet allows the consumption of all four main food groups including meat and other animal by-products that are important protein and fat sources. Most of us consume more proteins and fats than we need. An excess of proteins can cause kidney failure and/or osteoporosis, and a high-fat diet can eventually lead to heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. On the other hand, vegetarians get protein from grains, beans, vegetables, and low-fat food. This is how they reduce the risk of most diseases caused by fats. It is a myth to believe that vegetarians don’t get enough proteins or that their diet is not balanced because they don’t eat meat. The key is variety and accurate combinations of energy and protein sources.
If I were asked to describe a vegetarian, I would immediately mention they are very disciplined people. It has been proven that there exists a remarkable correlation between the people who succeed and people who follow a disciplined lifestyle. People who are faithful to the disciplines they have acquired show integrity, a remarkable behavior, and they are usually in a good mood. Vegetarians, always concerned about quality and discipline, develop a greater social responsibility that motivates them to improve their environment.
Moreover, environmental issues have been capturing public attention because of their relevancy and increasing deterioration of our quality of life. If you are concerned about the environment, consider that massive meat production can have a negative impact on tropical rain forests, soil stability, and air and water quality. Large extensions of forests have been cut and changed into grasslands that provide cattle with food. To conserve grasslands, fertilizers and other chemical substances are used; consequently, soil and water resources are polluted. Even though there are methods that avoid this kind of deterioration, producers prefer to ignore them so they can keep satisfying the increasing meat demand without affecting their production rates.
Vegetarians’ life spans are increased and through this discipline they learn to live quality life in all the possible aspects. Besides, their beliefs are congruent with their lifestyle and they take responsibility and action for problems within their own bodies and in their surroundings. Take a look at yourself. Is your health at risk? Have you been able to reach your goals? Are you a factor of change and improvement within your society? You must at least try becoming a vegetarian now that you know it is a tempting challenge and an exciting experiment that has advantages and no risks. Do it for your body, for your lifestyle, or for your environment, but do it. Stop letting others have all the credit, the fun, and the quality.

                            11. Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish –a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphorical is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is perpasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentaly metaphorical in nature.The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to mundane details. Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we experience, and what we do everyday is very much a matter of metaphor.But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do everyday, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting, language is an important source of evidence for what the system like. Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence, we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature. Shortly, to give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such concept to structure an everyday activity, let us see the concept ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety expressions, such as; Your claims are indefensible, He attacked every weakpoint in my argument, His criticisms were right on target, I’ve never won an argument with him, You disagree, okay, shoot!, and the like.(Source: Metaphors We Live by, George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson, 2003: 11)Find the meaning of the following words or phrase based on the above text!1. metaphor:..........................................................................................................2. conceptual system:........................................................................................3. mundane:..........................................................................................​</h2><br />

                            26. Read the passage.
Vegetarianism has become the most popular diet among the young generations facing the new millennium. This discipline eliminates the intake of meat and in some cases also the consumption of dairy products and eggs. Are there enough reasons to make you change your eating habits? My purpose is to prove that vegetarianism is the diet that offers more benefits to our health, spirit, and society.
Nowadays, health is the number one individual and governmental concern. Health is a fragile factor and its behavior relies mostly on the nutritional quality of the food we ingest. A balanced non-vegetarian diet allows the consumption of all four main food groups including meat and other animal by-products that are important protein and fat sources. Most of us consume more proteins and fats than we need. An excess of proteins can cause kidney failure and/or osteoporosis, and a high-fat diet can eventually lead to heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. On the other hand, vegetarians get protein from grains, beans, vegetables, and low-fat food. This is how they reduce the risk of most diseases caused by fats. It is a myth to believe that vegetarians don’t get enough proteins or that their diet is not balanced because they don’t eat meat. The key is variety and accurate combinations of energy and protein sources.
If I were asked to describe a vegetarian, I would immediately mention they are very disciplined people. It has been proven that there exists a remarkable correlation between the people who succeed and people who follow a disciplined lifestyle. People who are faithful to the disciplines they have acquired show integrity, a remarkable behavior, and they are usually in a good mood. Vegetarians, always concerned about quality and discipline, develop a greater social responsibility that motivates them to improve their environment.
Moreover, environmental issues have been capturing public attention because of their relevancy and increasing deterioration of our quality of life. If you are concerned about the environment, consider that massive meat production can have a negative impact on tropical rain forests, soil stability, and air and water quality. Large extensions of forests have been cut and changed into grasslands that provide cattle with food. To conserve grasslands, fertilizers and other chemical substances are used; consequently, soil and water resources are polluted. Even though there are methods that avoid this kind of deterioration, producers prefer to ignore them so they can keep satisfying the increasing meat demand without affecting their production rates.
Vegetarians’ life spans are increased and through this discipline they learn to live quality life in all the possible aspects. Besides, their beliefs are congruent with their lifestyle and they take responsibility and action for problems within their own bodies and in their surroundings. Take a look at yourself. Is your health at risk? Have you been able to reach your goals? Are you a factor of change and improvement within your society? You must at least try becoming a vegetarian now that you know it is a tempting challenge and an exciting experiment that has advantages and no risks. Do it for your body, for your lifestyle, or for your environment, but do it. Stop letting others have all the credit, the fun, and the quality.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>1. Yes-No Questions:</p><p>   - Purpose: These questions are like asking if something is true or not. For example, "Is it raining?" You can answer with "yes" or "no."</p><p></p><p>2. Wh-Questions:</p><p>   - Purpose: These questions are for getting more information. They usually start with words like who, what, where, when, why, or how. For example, "What's your favorite color?" You need to give more than just "yes" or "no."</p><p></p><p>3. Tag Questions:</p><p>   - Purpose: These are like asking someone to agree with you. They come at the end of a sentence, like saying, "It's a nice day, isn't it?" You expect the other person to agree.</p><p></p><p>4. Rhetorical Questions:</p><p>   - Purpose: These are questions you ask, but you don't really expect an answer. You use them to make a point, like saying, "Who wouldn't want ice cream?" You're not really asking for an answer; you're just saying that everyone likes ice cream.</p><p></p><p>These different questions help us talk to each other, learn things, and share our thoughts and ideas in different ways.
