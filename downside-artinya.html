                                            The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised up its global economic growth forecast to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018, as it projects a slight recovery in worldwide economic activity. The IMF's growth forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 are 0.1 percentage point stronger compared with its forecast back in April, the fund stated in its October edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The latest WEO was published on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. In its forecast, the fund saw that some regions, including emerging Asia, had better-than-expected growth outcomes during the first half of this year, which more than offset the downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. “But the recovery is not complete: while the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies,” the report said. The IMF called for policymakers to seize "the window of opportunity in cyclical pickup of global economy". The IMF suggested that policymakers tackle their key policy challenges to boost potential economic output while ensuring its benefits were broadly shared, and to build resilience against downside risks. “Policymakers should seize the moment: the recovery is still incomplete in important respects, and the window for action the current cyclical upswing offers will not be open forever,” said IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld at a press conference during the ongoing 2017 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C.

                                                   Internet banking has become so mainstream. Few would argue that online banking is not an advantageous tool that fits handsomely into the fast-paced world in which we live. The convenience is undeniable. But while the pros of online banking certainly outweigh the cons, there are a few drawbacks. Let’s look at both the upside and the downside of online banking.
       Online banking for the most part is as easy as using any other interactive website. With a few clicks and keystrokes, even the most inexperienced internet user can be up and running on their online bank account in no time. Most banks even offer 24-hour live customer service or email customer service capability. Besides, most banks not only offer their customers the convenience of online banking, they also feature mobile-friendly websites that allow customersto do their banking on the go. The apps the banks are offering are being implemented with more and more features all the time in an effort to expand on the convenience that is afforded smart phone users.
       There is still the most significant drawback to online banking. The new millennium is the age of the computer hacker and identity theft is one of the most widespread social diseases in America and around the world. As such, despite every bank's best effort to keep its website secure, unfortunately nothing is foolproof and there is always at least a slight risk that someone somewhere will hack into your account and gain access to sensitive information. Depositing cash, making certain types of international transactions, and other service issues can be challenging to address via email or even real-time customer service chat capability. With some service issues, it behooves the customer to make a trip to the bank and get their needs met face-to-face.

                                            1. The questions number 1-3 are based on the following passage. In the US, consumers spend around $700 million a year keeping their fabrics soft. In the UK people spend £200 million a year on fabric softener. A giant manufacturer even claims a massive 50 percent share of the market. Despite the popularity, fabric softeners can be harmful to both the people who use them and the marine life that ends up swimming in them. Fabric softening surfactants can be derived from animals, plants or minerals, as in the case of newer, silicone-based formulations. There is little difference between the chemicals used in fabric softeners and those used in hair conditioners. Whatever they are based on, all fabric softeners work in pretty much the same way, by depositing these surfactants onto the fabric to make it feel softer, reduce static cling, and impart a fresh fragrance. Special fixatives in the mix of both standard and luxury conditioners mean that the fragrance can last for days, permeating wardrobes and drawers. The regular off-gassing of perfume chemicals from fabric softeners can be a significant trigger for asthma and other breathing problems. In the US, chemically sensitive individuals complain that, even after several washes, they cannot get the smell of fabric softeners out of their washing machines and dryers. If you are a fabric softener addict, there are now a number of companies that provide alternative and 'green' fabric softeners. However, essentially, these are unnecessary products that can trigger health problems and can interfere with the functional aspect of some textiles. For instance, when used on towels and nappies, some fabric softeners can reduce absorbency, which is why it's generally recommended that reusable nappies aren't washed with them. Once they are washed down the drain they can become highly toxic to aquatic life. Given this, maybe it's worth asking yourself whether the time has come to break the fabric softener habit completely. What does the passage mainly talk about? A. The downside of fabric softener usage B. The popularity of fabric softener in the US C. Harmful compounds found in fabric softener D. Controlling the habit of using fabric softener E. Environmental issues caused by fabric softener 2. The word permeating in the third paragraph is similar in meaning with d. attaining A. Filling b. soaking c. charging e. absorbing ... 3. Based on the passage, it can be hypothesized that A. 'Green' softeners are developed in response to the needs of fabric softener addicts. B. Manufactures will shift to producing 'green' fabric softener products. C. A small amount of fabric softener chemicals in the water will not harm aquatic life. D. The absorbency in some textiles will be reduced if they are washed with fabric softeners. E. People with breathing problems will feel safer using fabric softener if it contains fewer perfume chemicals.​</a>

                                            Many who expected that (1).........(a/an/the) Group of 20, as an intergovernmental, premium
forum for international economic cooperation, would change the prospects of the gloomy outlook
of the global economy and would announce many concrete and collective programs of action to
address (2)...... (a/an/the) global food and energy insecurity, the problems of high inflation and
rising interest rates, may be disappointed. But judging the two-day G20 Leaders' Summit mainly
from the contents of their declaration we may misunderstand the dynamics, potential and
limitations of the multilateral forum, in view of the complexity of the geopolitical tensions after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union-Russia and United States-China tense
relations, abrupt economic slowdown and climate disasters, which have overshadowed the world
since March. (3)........ (a/an/the) tasks of the Indonesian presidency of the G20 this year should
have been the most challenging of all previous leaders' meetings. Nevertheless, similar to the
G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration in October 2021, almost 50 percent of the 52 points of the 16-

                                            4. The Book of Knowledge by al-Ghazali Al-Ghazali (1058-111) begins his monumental forty volume Ihya Ulum al-Din (The Revival of Religious Knowledge') with The Book of Knowledge. It is the first book of the first quarter on the Acts of Worship proceeding The Articles Purity'. In other words, knowledge is supreme worship for al-Ghazali. Peppered with hadith (not all particularly authentic it has to be said), aphorisms, and pearls of wisdoms from pious sages, The Book of Knowledge offers a discussion on the value of knowledge, the praiseworthy and objectionable branches of knowledge, the qualities needed in teachers and students and ends with a blistering praise of the 'noble nature' of the intellect. Al-Ghazali was perhaps the first to note that knowledge has a downside too it could be 'evil' designed to Faith' and The Mysteries of perpetuate injustice and suffering. And there is nothing worse than the 'learned hypocrite'. 'Knowledge is not the prolific retention of tradition, but the fear of God'. 5. Knowledge Triumphant by Franz Rosenthal It would be reasonable to assumed that thinkers and scholars such as al-Ghazali, ibn Jammah, al-Zarnuji and Miskawayh were obsessed by the concept of knowledge. Or, more appropriately, ilm, which is normally translated as knowledge. But the term knowledge' does not fully express the factual and emotional content of ilm, which has a deeper and wider meaning. Given that it was a central concept for Muslim civilisation, the delineation of its full meaning was seen as paramount. At the zenith of Muslim civilisation, over 500 definitions of ilm were being discussed and debated and most are explored in this meticulously researched classic by Franz Rosenthal (1914-2003), a renowned German scholar of Islam and Arabic literature, who taught at Yale University for some decades. There is no branch of intellectual, religious, political and daily life of the 'average Muslim' that remained untouched by the all- pervasive concept of ilm, notes Rosenthal. What does it mean for a civilization, and beyond it, for the history of mankind, if knowledge is made its central concern'? he asks. His answer: 'a great deal can be achieved by the fusion of intellectual and spiritual values in one dominant concept' but there are 'drawbacks' most notably, the danger of the spiritual subsuming the intellectual. 6. The Rise of Colleges by George Makdisi What use is knowledge if it cannot be transmitted to the next generation? Institutions devoted to thought, learning and education were needed to perform this task. The Rise of College, subtitled 'Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West', tells us everything we need to know about the emergence of colleges and universities in the Muslim world, from their organisational and administrative structure to how they were funded, their curriculum, the methods of teaching and learning, the designation of professors and the classification of students, the intellectual ferment of the scholastic community to how the Muslim system of education was transmitted to the West. George Makdisi (1920-2002), who was Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at University of Pennsylvania, is rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest Arabists of his generation The Rise of Colleges provides ample evidence of this fact.Tentukan main idea dan supporting detailsnya dari setiap nomor 4-6! mohon dibantu ​</a>

But, the amount of time it takes to grow foods industrially compared with organic methods is not the only downside. Another disadvantage to organic gardening is that these gardeners are usually not able to use genetically modified food crops. But genetically modified, or GM, food crops are able to resist pests, which is major plus for industrialized and conventional gardens.All in all, there are many advantages and disadvantages to organic gardening.

                                            A rather surprising geographical feature of Antarctica is that a huge freshwater lake, one of the world’s largest and deepest, lies hidden there under four kilometers of ice. Now known as Lake Vostok, this huge body of water is located under the ice block that comprises Antarctica. The lake is able to exist in its unfrozen state beneath this block of ice because its waters are warmed by geothermal heat from the earth’s core. The thick glacier above Lake Vostok actually insulates it from the frigid temperatures (the lowest ever recorded on Earth) on the surface. The lake was first discovered in the 1970s while a research team was conducting an aerial survey of the area. Radio waves from the survey equipment penetrated the ice and revealed a body of water of indeterminate size. It was not until much more recently that data collected by satellite made scientists aware of the tremendous size of the lake; the satellite-borne radar detected an extremely flat region where the ice remains level because it is floating on the water of the lake. The discovery of such a huge freshwater lake trapped under Antarctica is of interest to the scientific community because of the potential that the lake contains ancient microbes that have survived for thousands upon thousands of years, unaffected by factors such as nuclear fallout and elevated ultraviolet light that have affected organisms in more exposed areas. The downside of the discovery, however, lies in the difficulty of conducting research on the lake in such a harsh climate and in the problems associated with obtaining uncontaminated samples from the lake without actually exposing the lake to contamination. Scientists are looking for possible ways to accomplish this. Which of the following is closest in meaning to frigid in the last sentence of paragraph 1?</a>

Tangkuban perahu (West Java)
Long time ago in west java, there lived a woman named Dayang Sumbi. She lived alone and she was thirsting for a husband or a live-friend.
One day when quilting, her quilt fell off from her house. Then, she prayed to the God, “ If a man picks up my quilt, he will be my husband. If a woman, she will be my sister. “ Then, a male dog picked it up.
For keeping her words , so Dayang Sumbi got married to the dog and called him Tumang.
Dayang Sumbi gave a birth to a baby , named him Sangkuriang , but never tell him who was his father. One day, Sangkuriang was hunting with Tumang in the forest and he found nothing . He blamed Tumang for the failure and killed Tumang. When Dayang Sumbi knew that , she hit Sangkuriang’s head with a big spoon and expelled  him.
Many years later , the wandering Sangkuriang found a house in the forest, and old beautiful woman was in the house. The woman , Dayang Sumbi , recognized the adventurer as Sangkuriang . Sangkuriang forced her to marry him and she told that Sangkuriang had to build a vast boat for their honeymoon , just in one night.
In the night, Sangkuriang called his friends, ghosts and forest fairies to help him. Feared the boat to complete , Dayang  Sumbi asked some women in the nearby to help her. So, the women punched the grains with grains puncher to make noise which disturbed ghosts and the fairies.
The morning came before they completed the boat. The ghost and the fairies ran away , leaving sangkuriang . Then , he kicked away the boat to the downside , and it turned into a mountain , called Tangkuban Perahu means Downside Boat , which stood in the north of Bandung.</a>

                            4. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised up its global economic growth forecast to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018, as it projects a slight recovery in worldwide economic activity. The IMF's growth forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 are 0.1 percentage point stronger compared with its forecast back in April, the fund stated in its October edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The latest WEO was published on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. In its forecast, the fund saw that some regions, including emerging Asia, had better-than-expected growth outcomes during the first half of this year, which more than offset the downward revisions for the United States and the United Kingdom. “But the recovery is not complete: while the baseline outlook is strengthening, growth remains weak in many countries, and inflation is below target in most advanced economies,” the report said. The IMF called for policymakers to seize "the window of opportunity in cyclical pickup of global economy". The IMF suggested that policymakers tackle their key policy challenges to boost potential economic output while ensuring its benefits were broadly shared, and to build resilience against downside risks. “Policymakers should seize the moment: the recovery is still incomplete in important respects, and the window for action the current cyclical upswing offers will not be open forever,” said IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld at a press conference during the ongoing 2017 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C.

                            5.        Internet banking has become so mainstream. Few would argue that online banking is not an advantageous tool that fits handsomely into the fast-paced world in which we live. The convenience is undeniable. But while the pros of online banking certainly outweigh the cons, there are a few drawbacks. Let’s look at both the upside and the downside of online banking.
       Online banking for the most part is as easy as using any other interactive website. With a few clicks and keystrokes, even the most inexperienced internet user can be up and running on their online bank account in no time. Most banks even offer 24-hour live customer service or email customer service capability. Besides, most banks not only offer their customers the convenience of online banking, they also feature mobile-friendly websites that allow customersto do their banking on the go. The apps the banks are offering are being implemented with more and more features all the time in an effort to expand on the convenience that is afforded smart phone users.
       There is still the most significant drawback to online banking. The new millennium is the age of the computer hacker and identity theft is one of the most widespread social diseases in America and around the world. As such, despite every bank's best effort to keep its website secure, unfortunately nothing is foolproof and there is always at least a slight risk that someone somewhere will hack into your account and gain access to sensitive information. Depositing cash, making certain types of international transactions, and other service issues can be challenging to address via email or even real-time customer service chat capability. With some service issues, it behooves the customer to make a trip to the bank and get their needs met face-to-face.

                            6. 1. The questions number 1-3 are based on the following passage. In the US, consumers spend around $700 million a year keeping their fabrics soft. In the UK people spend £200 million a year on fabric softener. A giant manufacturer even claims a massive 50 percent share of the market. Despite the popularity, fabric softeners can be harmful to both the people who use them and the marine life that ends up swimming in them. Fabric softening surfactants can be derived from animals, plants or minerals, as in the case of newer, silicone-based formulations. There is little difference between the chemicals used in fabric softeners and those used in hair conditioners. Whatever they are based on, all fabric softeners work in pretty much the same way, by depositing these surfactants onto the fabric to make it feel softer, reduce static cling, and impart a fresh fragrance. Special fixatives in the mix of both standard and luxury conditioners mean that the fragrance can last for days, permeating wardrobes and drawers. The regular off-gassing of perfume chemicals from fabric softeners can be a significant trigger for asthma and other breathing problems. In the US, chemically sensitive individuals complain that, even after several washes, they cannot get the smell of fabric softeners out of their washing machines and dryers. If you are a fabric softener addict, there are now a number of companies that provide alternative and 'green' fabric softeners. However, essentially, these are unnecessary products that can trigger health problems and can interfere with the functional aspect of some textiles. For instance, when used on towels and nappies, some fabric softeners can reduce absorbency, which is why it's generally recommended that reusable nappies aren't washed with them. Once they are washed down the drain they can become highly toxic to aquatic life. Given this, maybe it's worth asking yourself whether the time has come to break the fabric softener habit completely. What does the passage mainly talk about? A. The downside of fabric softener usage B. The popularity of fabric softener in the US C. Harmful compounds found in fabric softener D. Controlling the habit of using fabric softener E. Environmental issues caused by fabric softener 2. The word permeating in the third paragraph is similar in meaning with d. attaining A. Filling b. soaking c. charging e. absorbing ... 3. Based on the passage, it can be hypothesized that A. 'Green' softeners are developed in response to the needs of fabric softener addicts. B. Manufactures will shift to producing 'green' fabric softener products. C. A small amount of fabric softener chemicals in the water will not harm aquatic life. D. The absorbency in some textiles will be reduced if they are washed with fabric softeners. E. People with breathing problems will feel safer using fabric softener if it contains fewer perfume chemicals.​</h2><br />

                            12. 4. The Book of Knowledge by al-Ghazali Al-Ghazali (1058-111) begins his monumental forty volume Ihya Ulum al-Din (The Revival of Religious Knowledge') with The Book of Knowledge. It is the first book of the first quarter on the Acts of Worship proceeding The Articles Purity'. In other words, knowledge is supreme worship for al-Ghazali. Peppered with hadith (not all particularly authentic it has to be said), aphorisms, and pearls of wisdoms from pious sages, The Book of Knowledge offers a discussion on the value of knowledge, the praiseworthy and objectionable branches of knowledge, the qualities needed in teachers and students and ends with a blistering praise of the 'noble nature' of the intellect. Al-Ghazali was perhaps the first to note that knowledge has a downside too it could be 'evil' designed to Faith' and The Mysteries of perpetuate injustice and suffering. And there is nothing worse than the 'learned hypocrite'. 'Knowledge is not the prolific retention of tradition, but the fear of God'. 5. Knowledge Triumphant by Franz Rosenthal It would be reasonable to assumed that thinkers and scholars such as al-Ghazali, ibn Jammah, al-Zarnuji and Miskawayh were obsessed by the concept of knowledge. Or, more appropriately, ilm, which is normally translated as knowledge. But the term knowledge' does not fully express the factual and emotional content of ilm, which has a deeper and wider meaning. Given that it was a central concept for Muslim civilisation, the delineation of its full meaning was seen as paramount. At the zenith of Muslim civilisation, over 500 definitions of ilm were being discussed and debated and most are explored in this meticulously researched classic by Franz Rosenthal (1914-2003), a renowned German scholar of Islam and Arabic literature, who taught at Yale University for some decades. There is no branch of intellectual, religious, political and daily life of the 'average Muslim' that remained untouched by the all- pervasive concept of ilm, notes Rosenthal. What does it mean for a civilization, and beyond it, for the history of mankind, if knowledge is made its central concern'? he asks. His answer: 'a great deal can be achieved by the fusion of intellectual and spiritual values in one dominant concept' but there are 'drawbacks' most notably, the danger of the spiritual subsuming the intellectual. 6. The Rise of Colleges by George Makdisi What use is knowledge if it cannot be transmitted to the next generation? Institutions devoted to thought, learning and education were needed to perform this task. The Rise of College, subtitled 'Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West', tells us everything we need to know about the emergence of colleges and universities in the Muslim world, from their organisational and administrative structure to how they were funded, their curriculum, the methods of teaching and learning, the designation of professors and the classification of students, the intellectual ferment of the scholastic community to how the Muslim system of education was transmitted to the West. George Makdisi (1920-2002), who was Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at University of Pennsylvania, is rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest Arabists of his generation The Rise of Colleges provides ample evidence of this fact.Tentukan main idea dan supporting detailsnya dari setiap nomor 4-6! mohon dibantu ​</h2><br />

                            17. Many who expected that (1).........Group of 20, as an intergovernmental, premium
forum for international economic cooperation, would change the prospects of the gloomy outlook
of the global economy and would announce many concrete and collective programs of action to
address (2)...... global food and energy insecurity, the problems of high inflation and
rising interest rates, may be disappointed. But judging the two-day G20 Leaders' Summit mainly
from the contents of their declaration we may misunderstand the dynamics, potential and
limitations of the multilateral forum, in view of the complexity of the geopolitical tensions after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union-Russia and United States-China tense
relations, abrupt economic slowdown and climate disasters, which have overshadowed the world
since March. (3)........ tasks of the Indonesian presidency of the G20 this year should
have been the most challenging of all previous leaders' meetings. Nevertheless, similar to the
G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration in October 2021, almost 50 percent of the 52 points of the 16-
page G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration still addresses the ongoing problems in the economy and
such sectors as fair, multilateral trade, energy and food security, financial structure and stability,
international taxation and investment, digital economy, debt restructuring etc. All the policy
recommendations are aimed to support (4)....... theme "Recover Together, Recover
Stronger," which Indonesia assigned to its presidency this year. (5)....... leaders also
reaffirm their commitment to stay agile and flexible in their macro-economic policy responses
and cooperation, make public investments and structural reforms, promote private investments
and strengthen multilateral trade and resilience of global supply chains to support long-term
growth and sustainable, inclusive, green and just transitions. They will also work to ensure long-
term fiscal sustainability, with our central banks committed to achieving price stability. (6)........
heads of state also stress their commitment to protecting macroeconomic and
financial stability and remain committed to using all available tools to mitigate downside risks,
noting the steps taken since the global financial crisis, to strengthen financial resilience and
promote sustainable finance and capital flows. Encouraging, too, is that (7)........ 
G20's Common Framework for debt treatment is finally beginning to deliver agreements with
several most vulnerable countries. But the summit should also be assessed from the series of
policy discussions conducted over the past 10 months by the 12 working groups, 10
engagement groups, finance ministers and central bank chiefs under the G20 umbrella. The
reports of those meetings were attached to the leaders' declaration. Yet, no less important were
the bilateral meetings of the leaders taking place on the sidelines of the summit as those
between the US and China and the exchanges of views among (8)...... thousands of
business leaders from across the world. As the summit coincided with the 2022 United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt, the gathering also witnessed (9.)...….... 
very
Group, co-led by the US and Japan and President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo launched
(10)...... Tuesday a Just Energy Transition Partnership, which will raise about US$20
billion in government and private financing for Indonesia to enable the country to early retire its
coal-fired plants.

                            18. A rather surprising geographical feature of Antarctica is that a huge freshwater lake, one of the world’s largest and deepest, lies hidden there under four kilometers of ice. Now known as Lake Vostok, this huge body of water is located under the ice block that comprises Antarctica. The lake is able to exist in its unfrozen state beneath this block of ice because its waters are warmed by geothermal heat from the earth’s core. The thick glacier above Lake Vostok actually insulates it from the frigid temperatures (the lowest ever recorded on Earth) on the surface. The lake was first discovered in the 1970s while a research team was conducting an aerial survey of the area. Radio waves from the survey equipment penetrated the ice and revealed a body of water of indeterminate size. It was not until much more recently that data collected by satellite made scientists aware of the tremendous size of the lake; the satellite-borne radar detected an extremely flat region where the ice remains level because it is floating on the water of the lake. The discovery of such a huge freshwater lake trapped under Antarctica is of interest to the scientific community because of the potential that the lake contains ancient microbes that have survived for thousands upon thousands of years, unaffected by factors such as nuclear fallout and elevated ultraviolet light that have affected organisms in more exposed areas.

One day when quilting, her quilt fell off from her house. Then, she prayed to the God, “ If a man picks up my quilt, he will be my husband. If a woman, she will be my sister. “ Then, a male dog picked it up.
For keeping her words , so Dayang Sumbi got married to the dog and called him Tumang.
Dayang Sumbi gave a birth to a baby , named him Sangkuriang , but never tell him who was his father. One day, Sangkuriang was hunting with Tumang in the forest and he found nothing . He blamed Tumang for the failure and killed Tumang. When Dayang Sumbi knew that , she hit Sangkuriang’s head with a big spoon and expelled  him.
Many years later , the wandering Sangkuriang found a house in the forest, and old beautiful woman was in the house. The woman , Dayang Sumbi , recognized the adventurer as Sangkuriang . Sangkuriang forced her to marry him and she told that Sangkuriang had to build a vast boat for their honeymoon , just in one night.
In the night, Sangkuriang called his friends, ghosts and forest fairies to help him. Feared the boat to complete , Dayang  Sumbi asked some women in the nearby to help her. So, the women punched the grains with grains puncher to make noise which disturbed ghosts and the fairies.
