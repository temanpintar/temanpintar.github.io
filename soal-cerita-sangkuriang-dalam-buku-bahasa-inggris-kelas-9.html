When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother. Dayang Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a deep scar on his head. Sangkuriang travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother.

Tumang, a male dog, came to bring her tool back to her. As she had promised, she married him. Tuman was actually a man who had been cursed by a witch to become a dog. But sometimes I could turn back to a normal man. Dayang Sumbi and Tumang got one son. His name was Sangkuriang. He did not know that Tumang was his father because he was a dog whenever he was with him. Tumang always accompanied Sangkuriang whenever he went hunting in the woods.  
</p><p><strong>2. Complications
</strong></p><p>When he was twelve years old, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to bring her deer's heart. But after many days in the woods, he could not find a deer. He did not want to disappoint his mother, so he killed Tumang and brought his heart home and gave it to his mother. Because of her love to Tumang, Dayang Sumbi knew, it was his heart not a deer's heart. She got very angry at Sangkuriang. She hit him with a piece of wood on his forehead and told him to go away. Badly wounded, Sangkuriang left her and the village.
</p><p>One day Sangkuriang went back to his village. He was big and strong. There he met a beautiful young woman. He fell in love with her at first sight. He did not know that she was Dayang Sumbi. She could never get older because she was granted eternal youth by the gods
</p><p>One day he approached Dayang Sumbi to propose her. Dayang Sumbi saw the bad scar on his forehead. She soon realized that he was her own son, Sangkuriang. She told him the truth again and again but he would not believe her. She was thinking hard to find a way not to marry him. Then she got an idea. She gave him a task which she thought was impossible for him to do. She asked him to make her a lake and a boat in one night. She did not know Sangkuriang had genies to help him to do the task.  </p><p><strong>3. Resolution
</strong></p><p>
By dawn both the lake and the boat were almost done. Dayang Sumbi got very worried. She was thinking hard again to find a way to fail him. Then she had an idea. She asked the people in the village to burn the woods in the east, so that the light made all the cocks in the village crow. The genies thought that the morning was almost broken. They ran away as fast they could, leaving the boat unfinished. Knowing Dayang Sumbi cheated him, Sangkuriang got very angry. He kicked the boat so hard that it went upside down. It is now known as Mount Tangkuban Perahu.

But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p></p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p></p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p></p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p></p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).<br />

                        <p></p>Bahasa inggris:Once upon a time in the old days when playing a pig was passing in the wilderness. The boar was relaxing in the hot sun. As he searched for springs, he saw that water was collected in the taro trees of the forest.
<p>
</p>Drink the water immediately to quench your thirst. Without realizing it, that air is King Sungging Perbangkara's senior air. Because of the power of Raja Sungging Perbangkara, the boar was pregnant after drinking its urine. Nine months later the boar starts a baby girl.
<p>
</p>king of Sungging Perbangkara knows about the existence of a baby girl born because of the artistic air. He also went to the forest to look for it. The baby girl is expected. He also said Dayang Sumbi and returned to the royal palace.
<p>
</p>Court Lady Sunbi grew up to be a very beautiful woman. It felt like the countless kings, princes and nobles who wanted to marry the daughter of King Sungging Perbangkara. However, all the proposals were rejected by Dayang Sumbi smoothly. Not at all rejected by Dayang Sumbi, those who were rejected by the proposal fought each other to fight over themselves.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sad to understand the reality of the princes, kings and nobles whom he refused to fight each other. He also begged King Sungging Perbangkara to exile himself. The King finally allows you to isolate yourself. Dayang Sumbi secluded herself on a hill accompanied by a male dog named the tumang. To fill his spare time while in exile, Dayang Sumbi also weaved.

"Whoever receives the fallen weaving equipment, if I were a man I would make a husband, if he were a woman he would be my brother."
<p>
</p>None of them took the fallen weaving equipment and gave it to Dayang Sumbi.
<p>
</p>There was nothing that Dayang Sumbi could do other than fulfill her words. He was married to Si Tumang who turned out to be incarnation of a god. The Tumang is a god who is cursed into an animal and thrown to earth. A few months after marriage, Dayang Sumbi was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy. Dayang Sumbi received the name Sangkuriang.

After a while in the forest, Sangkuriang saw a deer grazing behind a thicket. Sangkuriang invited the tumang to chase the deer Very strange, the Tumang who is usually obedient, the compilation did not obey his orders. Sangkuriang became angry. He said. "If asked to remain not according to my instructions, surely I will kill you."
<p>
</p>The threat of Sangkuriang seems to be ignored by Tumang. Because annoyed and angry, then Sangkuriang killed the Tumang. He took the black dog's heart and brought it home. Sangkuriang gives the Tumang's heart to be submitted for cooking.
<p>
</p>Unknowingly Dayang Sumbi, who was given the heart, was given. He then cooks and processes it. So, Dayang Sumbi's anger at Sangkuriang cannot be compiled, she knows that the heart she eats is the heart of the Tumang. He then grabbed a dipper made from a coconut shell and hit Sangkuriang's head, until Sangkuriang's head was injured.
<p>
</p>Sangkuriang was very angry and hurt by the guidance. According to him, his mother loved the Tumang more than he. So, without saying goodbye to Dayang Sumbi, Sangkuriang then wandered eastward.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sorry after learning about the departure of Sangkuriang the goat. He also imprisoned and begged forgiveness to the gods for the mistakes he made. The gods heard the request of Dayang Sumbi, they accepted the apology and gave Dayang Sumbi eternal beauty.
<p>

The twigs are dumped on the west and become a burangrang mountain. With the help of the gubercles (genres), the dam is almost finished. The empress was also very concerned and appealed to the gods to prevent her plot from being fulfilled. The sumbi woman spreads a wedge of boeh ranged (its white cloth) and the dawn is breaking on the eastern horizon.</p><p></p><p>He was furious, knowing that he could not complete the request of dayang sumbi. At the top of its ang, a dam at the sanghyang was pushed at the tikoro, a blockage of the citarum river was cast and turned into a mountain mang. Bandung waters subsided. The boat he worked on he hardly kicked him northward and transformed into a parahu mountain of tangkuban.</p><p></p><p>He chased after the sumbi daemon, who suddenly disappeared on the princess's mountain and turned into a single cherry blossom.

Disappointed with his mother’s treatment, Sangkuriang decided to go wandering, and left his home.<br /><br />After the incident, Dayang Sumbi regretted her actions. She prayed daily, and asked that one day she was able to meet her son again. Because of the sincerity of Dayang Sumbi’s prayer, then God gave her a gift of eternal beauty and young age forever.<br /><br />After Sangkuriang was wandering for several years, he finally intended to return to his hometown. Once he was there, he was very surprised because his hometown had changed completely. Sangkuriang’s happiness increased when he met a very beautiful woman, Dayang Sumbi. Fascinated by the beauty of the woman, Sangkuriang immediately proposed her. Finally Sangkuriang proposal was accepted by Dayang Sumbi, and she agreed to be married in the near future.<br /><br />One day, Sangkuriang asked permission of his wife to hunt in the forest. Before leaving, he asked Dayang Sumbi to tighten and to tidy up his boat. Dayang Sumbi was surprised because when she loosened the headband Sangkuriang, she saw a scar. That scar seemed like his son’s. After asking Sangkuriang about the cause of the wound, Dayang Sumbi’s surprised grew increasingly because it was true that her husband was her own child.<br />Dayang Sumbi was very confused, because it was impossible to marry her own son. After Sangkuriang came home from hunting, Dayang Sumbi tried to talk to Sangkuriang, so Sangkuriang canceled their wedding plans. Dayang Sumbi’s request was not approved by Sangkuriang.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi thought how to make their marriage never happen. After thinking hard, finally Dayang Sumbi found the best way. She proposed two conditions to Sangkuriang. If Sangkuriang could meet both these conditions, then Dayang Sumbi wanted to be his wife, but otherwise if it failed then the wedding would be canceled. The first condition was she wanted the Citarum River to be dammed. And the second was she asked Sangkuriang to make a very big boat to cross the river. The second condition must be finished before dawn.<br /><br />Sangkuriang undertook both Dayang Sumbi’s requests, and promised to finish it before dawn. With his supernatural powers, Sangkuriang then mobilized his friends from the jinn to help him complete the task. Secretly, Dayang Sumbi peeked the work of Sangkuriang. How surprised she was. Sangkuriang almost finished all the conditions given by Dayang Sumbi before dawn.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi then asked her neighbors for a red silk cloth in the east of the city. When she saw the color of red in the east of the city, Sangkuriang thought that the day was early morning. Sangkuriang immediately stopped his job and felt unable to meet the requirements proposed by Dayang Sumbi.<br /><br />With a sense of annoyance and disappointment, Sangkuriang then break through the dam that he had made himself. Because the dam collapsed, there was flooding and the whole city was inundated. Sangkuriang also kicked the big boat he had made. The canoe floated and fell facedown, then into a mountain called Tangkuban Perahu.<br /><br /><br /><br />
