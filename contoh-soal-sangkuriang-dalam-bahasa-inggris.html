                        Once
 upon a time, a beautiful lady named Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a boy 
which she named Sangkuriang. When Sangkuriang was old enough to hunt, he
 took his mother’s dog Tumang (which according to this legend is an 
incarnation of a god and also Sangkuriang’s father) and ordered Tumang 
to chase after a boar. When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, 
Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out 
Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother.<br />Dayang
 Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that 
the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. 
She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a
 deep scar on his head.<br />Sangkuriang
 travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his 
village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell 
in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother. He 
asked for her hand in marriage and she agreed.<br />Dayang
 Sumbi later realized that Sangkuriang was her son, as she recognized 
the scar that she had inflicted. She tried to tell him and break off the
 wedding, but he didn’t believe her and insisted to go on with the 
wedding. Dayang Sumbi then set an impossible condition that Sangkuriang 
has to fulfill in order to marry her: he should build her a big boat and
 a lake by damming Citarum river, all within one night, and it shall be 
finished by dawn. Sangkuriang agreed to the condition.<br />He
 built a boat from a large tree, and with the help of spirits, he dammed
 the Citarum river with landslides. The water eventually rose and filled
 the plain, turning it into a lake. When dawn was near, he was almost 
ready. Dayang Sumbi realized this, so she prayed for divine 
intervention. As an answer to her prayers, the eastern horizon lit up. 
Deceived by the lights, cocks crowed and farmers rose for the new day, 
thinking that dawn has broken.<br />Sangkuriang
 was also deceived. He thought his endeavor has failed. Angrily, he 
kicked the boat so that it toppled over. This boat became Tangkuban 
Parahu mountain (tangkuban means upside down, and parahu means boat). 
The pile of leftover woods became Mt. Burangrang, and the rest of the 
big tree became Mt. Bukit Tunggul. The lake became lake Bandung (which 
literally means ‘dam’).<br /><br />

Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam). <br />

The kid was very fond of hunting in the forest. He was always accompanied by a pet dog named Tumang when he went for hunting. Tumang was actually an incarnation of God, and was also the real father of Sangkuriang, but Sangkuriang did not know it and his mother was deliberately kept it a secret.<br /><br />One day, as usual Sangkuriang went to the forest for hunting. After arriving in the forest, Sangkuriang began to look for game. He saw a bird perched on a branch, then without a second thought Sangkuriang immediately shot on target. Sangkuriang then ordered Tumang to chase his quarry earlier, but the Tumang kept silent and did not want to follow the order of Sangkuriang. He was very annoyed. Then he expelled Tumang and did not allowed him to go home again.<br /><br />Arriving at home, Sangkuriang told the incident to his mother. Upon hearing the story of his son, Dayang Sumbi was very angry. She picked up a spoon of rice, and banged on Sangkuriang’s head. Disappointed with his mother’s treatment, Sangkuriang decided to go wandering, and left his home.<br /><br />After the incident, Dayang Sumbi regretted her actions. She prayed daily, and asked that one day she was able to meet her son again. Because of the sincerity of Dayang Sumbi’s prayer, then God gave her a gift of eternal beauty and young age forever.<br /><br />After Sangkuriang was wandering for several years, he finally intended to return to his hometown. Once he was there, he was very surprised because his hometown had changed completely. Sangkuriang’s happiness increased when he met a very beautiful woman, Dayang Sumbi. Fascinated by the beauty of the woman, Sangkuriang immediately proposed her. Finally Sangkuriang proposal was accepted by Dayang Sumbi, and she agreed to be married in the near future.<br /><br />One day, Sangkuriang asked permission of his wife to hunt in the forest. Before leaving, he asked Dayang Sumbi to tighten and to tidy up his boat. Dayang Sumbi was surprised because when she loosened the headband Sangkuriang, she saw a scar. That scar seemed like his son’s. After asking Sangkuriang about the cause of the wound, Dayang Sumbi’s surprised grew increasingly because it was true that her husband was her own child.<br />Dayang Sumbi was very confused, because it was impossible to marry her own son. After Sangkuriang came home from hunting, Dayang Sumbi tried to talk to Sangkuriang, so Sangkuriang canceled their wedding plans. Dayang Sumbi’s request was not approved by Sangkuriang.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi thought how to make their marriage never happen. After thinking hard, finally Dayang Sumbi found the best way. She proposed two conditions to Sangkuriang. If Sangkuriang could meet both these conditions, then Dayang Sumbi wanted to be his wife, but otherwise if it failed then the wedding would be canceled. The first condition was she wanted the Citarum River to be dammed. And the second was she asked Sangkuriang to make a very big boat to cross the river. The second condition must be finished before dawn.<br /><br />Sangkuriang undertook both Dayang Sumbi’s requests, and promised to finish it before dawn. With his supernatural powers, Sangkuriang then mobilized his friends from the jinn to help him complete the task. Secretly, Dayang Sumbi peeked the work of Sangkuriang. How surprised she was. Sangkuriang almost finished all the conditions given by Dayang Sumbi before dawn.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi then asked her neighbors for a red silk cloth in the east of the city. When she saw the color of red in the east of the city, Sangkuriang thought that the day was early morning. Sangkuriang immediately stopped his job and felt unable to meet the requirements proposed by Dayang Sumbi.<br /><br />With a sense of annoyance and disappointment, Sangkuriang then break through the dam that he had made himself. Because the dam collapsed, there was flooding and the whole city was inundated. Sangkuriang also kicked the big boat he had made. The canoe floated and fell facedown, then into a mountain called Tangkuban Perahu.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p>They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p>Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung.</p><br />

                        <p>Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang 
Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a
 prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. 
The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. 
People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his
 father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince 
would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p>They
 get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave 
birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. 
Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his 
father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One 
day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His 
arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went 
home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was 
appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and 
hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay 
any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p>Sangkuriang feel 
sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? 
Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a 
journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She 
started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was
 no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find 
him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell 
asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be
 sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with 
water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” 
said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak 
the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p>And
 time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met
 and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the 
village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, 
Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry 
him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to 
fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a 
scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang
 on the head.</p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for 
guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was 
indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to 
prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to 
disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to 
marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he 
provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p>Sangkuriang
 accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth 
studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the 
hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum 
River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A
 few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost 
finished the boat.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, 
realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. 
Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked 
them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving 
red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false 
dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s
 genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from 
the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his 
anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a 
valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu 
(Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With 
his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake 
becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from 
the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />one the days of yore, there came the story of one of the daughters in java heavy named Dayang Sumbi mmempunyai boy named sangkuriang, one day sangkuriang go hunting accompanied by a dog named Tumang, but Sangkuriang not know that the dog was an incarnation of the god and also at the same Father ,<br />Peda Sangkuriang met while hunting deer invitation, Sangkuriang remembered that the mother was very happy deer.

                            40. contoh cerita legenda SANGKURIANG dalam bahasa inggris beserta terjemahannya</h2><br />
                                                                   <strong>Sangkuriang</strong><br />Once upon a time, a beautiful lady named Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a boy which she named Sangkuriang. When Sangkuriang was old enough to hunt, he took his mother’s dog Tumang (which according to this legend is an incarnation of a god and also Sangkuriang’s father) and ordered Tumang to chase after a boar. When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother. Dayang Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a deep scar on his head. Sangkuriang travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother. He asked for her hand in marriage and she agreed. Dayang Sumbi later realized that Sangkuriang was her son, as she recognized the scar that she had inflicted. She tried to tell him and break off the wedding, but he didn’t believe her and insisted to go on with the wedding. Dayang Sumbi then set an impossible condition that Sangkuriang has to fulfill in order to marry her: he should build her a big boat and a lake by damming Citarum river, all within one night, and it shall be finished by dawn. Sangkuriang agreed to the condition. He built a boat from a large tree, and with the help of spirits, he dammed the Citarum river with landslides. The water eventually rose and filled the plain, turning it into a lake. When dawn was near, he was almost ready. Dayang Sumbi realized this, so she prayed for divine intervention. As an answer to her prayers, the eastern horizon lit up. Deceived by the lights, cocks crowed and farmers rose for the new day, thinking that dawn has broken. Sangkuriang was also deceived. He thought his endeavor has failed. Angrily, he kicked the boat so that it toppled over. This boat became Tangkuban Parahu mountain (tangkuban means upside down, and parahu means boat). The pile of leftover woods became Mt. Burangrang, and the rest of the big tree became Mt. Bukit Tunggul. The lake became lake Bandung (which literally means ‘dam’). <br />Terjemahan:<br />                                           <strong>Sangkuriang</strong><br />Pada zaman dahulu, sebuah wanita cantik bernama Dayang Sambi melahirkan anak laki-laki yang di beri nama Sangkuriang , ketika dia sudah cukup umur untuk berburu , dia membawa Tumang yang merupakan *Guk Guk* milik ibunya (dan menurut legenda , *Guk Guk* ini merupakan inkarnasi dewa dan juga Ayah Sangkuriang) dan memerintahkan Tumang untuk mengejar seekor babi liar. Ketika Tumang tidak mengikuti perintahnya, Sangkuriang marah dan dia membunuh Tumang. Dia mengambil hati Tumang dan membawa hati Tumang ke ibunya. Dayang Sumbi mengambil hati tersebut, memasaknya dan memakannya , ketika dia tau bahwa hati tersebut adalah milik Tumang, Suaminya, dia marah. Lalu dia mengusir anaknya, dan memukulnya dengan dengan sendok sup, meninggalkan bekas luka. Lalu Sangkuriang menjelajahi dunia. Setelah itu , dia kembali ke desa nya sendiri tanpa ia sadari. Dia melihat seorang wanita cantik lalu jatuh cinta kepadanya. Dia tidak tahu bahwa wanita itu adalah ibunya sendiri. Dia lalu mengajak wanita tersebut menikah , dan dia setuju. Akan tetapi tidak lama setelah itu Dayang Sumbi mengetahui bahwa Sangkuriang adalah anaknya sendiri karena dia mengenali bekas luka yang disebabkan olehnya. Dia mencoba untuk memberitahunya untuk membatalkan pernikahan, tapi dia menolak. Lalu Dayang Sumbi memberi syarat yang tidak mungkin dilakukan agar Sangkuriang dapat menikahinya : Dia harus membuatkan sebuah perahu besar dan sebuah danau yang membendung sungai Citarum , hanya dalam 1 malam , dan harus diselesaikan sebelum pagi hari. Sangkuriang menyetujuinya, lalu dia membuat sebuah perahu dari sebuah Pohon Besar, dan dengan bantuan jin, dia membendung sungai Citarum dengan Longsoran tanah. Akhirnya air naik dan mengisi daratan yang longsor, dan menjadi sebuah danau. Ketika pagi tiba, dia sudah siap. Mengetahui hal ini , Dayang Sumbi memohon kepada Dewa agar usaha Sangkuriang gagal. Doa nya dikabulkan, lalu matahari terbit . Berpikir bahwa hari sudah pagi , ayam berkokok dan Petani bangun untuk bekerja. Sangkuriang merasa dibohongi, usaha nya gagal. Karena marah , dia  menendang perahu yang dia buat supaya perahunya terbalik. Perahu ini lalu dikenal dengan nama Gunung Tangkuban Parahu (Tangkuban artinya terbalik, dan Parahu artinya perahu). Sisa Kayu menjadi Gunung Burangrang, dan sisa pohon menjadi Gunung Bukit Tunggul. Danaunya dikenal dengan nama Danau Bandung<br /><br />*Gak boleh pake kata Anj**** jadi diganti *Guk Guk*<br /><br /><br />
