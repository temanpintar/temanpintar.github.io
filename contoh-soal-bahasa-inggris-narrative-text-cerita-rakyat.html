                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

<p> </p>

<p>Long
ago, people lived happily under the rule of a king. The people of the kingdom
were very happy as they led a very prosperous life with an abundance of wealth
and no misfortunes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once,
the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim
centres at distant places. He decided to travel by foot to interact with his
people. People of distant places were very happy to have a conversation with
their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After
several weeks of travel, the king returned to the palace. He was quite happy
that he had visited many pilgrim centres and witnessed his people leading a
prosperous life. However, he had one regret.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He
had intolerable pain in his feet as it was his first trip by foot covering a
long distance. He complained to his ministers that the roads weren't
comfortable and that they were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He
said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those
roads as it would be painful for them too!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Considering
all this, he ordered his servants to cover the roads in the whole country with
leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
king's ministers were stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands
of cows would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficient quantity of
leather. And it would cost a huge amount of money also.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally,
a wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another
idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minister said, "Instead
of covering the roads with leather, why don't you just have a piece of leather
cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the wisdom of the
minister. He ordered a pair of leather shoes for himself and requested all his
countrymen also to wear shoes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Moral:
Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves.</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Feeling tired of fighting, they lived in the different places. Sura lived in the water and Baya lived in the land. The border was the beach, so they would never fight again.
</p><p>

                        “The Smartest Parrot“<br /><br /><br /><br />Once upon time, a man had a wonderful parrot. There was no other parrot like it. The parrot could say every word, except the name of the place where it was born, “Catano”.<br /><br />The man felt excited having the smartest parrot but he could not understand why the parrot would not say “Catano”. The man tried to teach the bird to say “Catano” however the parrot kept not saying the word.<br /><br />At the first, the man was very nice to the bird but then he got very angry. “You stupid bird!” pointed the man to the parrot. “Why can’t you say the word? Say Catano! Or I will kill you” the man said angrily. Although he tried hard to teach, the parrot would not say it. Then the man got so angry and shouted to the bird over and over; “Say Catano or I’ll kill you”. The bird kept not to say the word of Catano.<br /><br />One day, after he had been trying so many times to make the bird say “Catano”, the man really got very angry. He could not bear it. He picked the parrot and threw it into the chicken house. There were four old chickens for next dinner “You are as stupid as the chickens. Just stay with them” Said the man angrily. Then he continued to humble; “You know, I will cut the chicken for my meal. Next it will be your turn, I will eat you too, stupid parrot”. After that he left the chicken house.<br /><br />The next day, the man came back to the chicken house. He opened the door and was very surprised. He could not believe what he saw at the chicken house. There were three death chickens on the floor. At the moment, the parrot was standing proudly and screaming at the last old chicken; “Say Catano or I’ll kill you”.<br />

                        The Origin of The Name “Singapore”<br /><br />A hundred years ago there lived a king named Nila Utama, King of Srivijaya. One day, the king went sailing accompanied by his loyal bodyguards. Along the way, the hurricane came. The guards begged the king to cancel his plan. “Sir, it is dangerous if we continue the journey with this condition. It’s better if we stop first to a safer place. If I am not mistaken, there is a place nearby here named Tumasik Island. “What if we stay there while waiting for a safer condition?” Said the captain of the ship. The king approved this opinion. Their boat was docked to Tumasik Island shortly afterwards.<br /><br />Arriving on the island, King and several bodyguards left the ship and looked around the island. When they’re looking around, suddenly an animal which was not far from them flashed. The king was surprised and fascinated. The beast was so huge, looked dashing, and was golden in color.” What creature was that?” Asked the King to his guards. “If i am not mistaken, people call it “Singa”, your majesty,” one of his bodyguards replied. “What?” Asked the King to clarify. “Singa” replied the guard.<br /><br />The king then asked more explanation about the animal. Attentively, The King listened to all explanations from his bodyguard about the animal. “Then, we give the name of this place “Singapore”.”Meaning: The City of Lion which is derived from malay “Singa” (lion) and “Pura / Pore” (City)”. Since that time the town was named Singapore.<br /><br /><br />

                                                 Jaka Tarub <br /> Once upon a time there was a widow who lived in the village of Dadapan.  She had a son whose name was Jaka Tarub.  Dadapan village was close to a wood so Jaka Tarub liked to go to the wood.  He liked hunting for animals with his blowpipe.<br />One day when he was in the wood he saw a beautiful rainbow and he saw seven angels went down through it.  He came closer and searched for them.  The seven angels were swimming and taking a bath in a lake.  Jaka Tarub looked at them while hiding behind trees.  When they had finished taking a bath, they flew through the rainbow to heaven.<br />The next day he saw the same thing again.  This time Jaka Tarub had an idea.  He searched for their dress and when he found them he took one of them.  As they had finished swimming and taking a bath, they looked for their dress.  One of them could not find her dress.  Her friends had to come back to heaven so they left her.  She was crying while staying in the water.  Jaka Tarub approached her.<br />‘Why are you crying lady?’<br />‘I lose my dress so I cannot go home’<br />‘Where is your home?’<br />‘I live in heaven.  I’m an angel.  My name is Nawang Wulan.  But I lose my dress so I cannot fly anymore’<br />‘I you don’t mind I will take my mother’s dress for you’<br />‘OK, please do’<br />‘Wait for me here, I’ll be back’<br />Then Jaka Tarub went home to take her mother’s dress and gave it to Nawang Wulan.  He asked her to stay at her house with his mother.  Not long after that Jaka Tarub married Nawang Wulan.<br />As an angel Nawang Wulan had spiritual power.  She had ability which far above human being.  She could cook rice with just a bar of rice and when it had done the bowl will be full of rice.  But there was one condition.  The bowl must not be opened before it has done.  Jaka Tarub was very surprised with her wife’s ability. He was very curious about it.  So when Nawang Wulan was away he opened the bowl.  Consequently Nawang’s spiritual power disappeared.  She had to cook as ordinary human being.<br />Several months later Nawang Wulan gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.  Her name was Nawang Sih.  The birth of Nawang Sih added happiness to Jaka Tarub and Nawang Wulan.<br />Since Nawang Wulan could not cook efficiently anymore, she needed more rice than usual.  The stock of rice in their store room diminished rapidly.  Then one day when she took rice there she was very surprised.  Nawang Wulan found her angel dress.  It was hidden there under piles of rice.  She immediately wore it and talked to Jaka Tarub.<br />‘My dear husband, now I know what you did to me’<br />‘Forgive me, my dear.  I admit that I did this because I love you’<br />‘I love you too.  But now I find my dress.  I must come back to heaven.  I am an angel.  My place is not here.  I have to go now’.<br />‘How about Nawang Sih?  She needs you’‘I will leave her but don’t worry.  I will take care of her.  Anytime she needs me I will be here.  For that purpose please build a tower. When Nawang Sih cries put her there then call my name. I will come immediately.  But I will be invisible to you.  Good bye dear’<br />Then Jaka Tarub built a tower behind his house.  Every time Nawang Sih cried he would put her there.  Nawang Wulan would come and take care of Nawang Sih.      ...... SEMOGA MEMBANTU........<br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        “story of romance” is the guiding text offered by contemporary American culture, and more generally the culture of the modern West, on the subject of how women and men (should) relate: find your One True Love—your one-and-only—and live happily ever after.[1] To the ancient and perennial question of how to define and live the good life, how to achieve happiness and fulfillment, American pop culture’s resounding answer is through the narrative of romance, sex, and love. The happily-in-love, pair-bonded (generally, although increasingly not exclusively, heterosexual) couple is made into a near-mandatory norm by the media and popular culture, as this romance story is endlessly taught and replayed in a multiplicity of cultural sites: Disney princess movies consumed by three-year-olds, the wedding industry, Hollywood, pop music lyrics, advertising, popular magazines, the diamond jewelry industry, and more. One of the most important of these sites, where romance is taught, re-told, and—a crucial point—experimented with in new forms, is in the literal “romance story” of mass market genre fiction.While there are clearly significant differences—among these media forms and certainly among the diversity of the immense romance readership, as well as in the variety of subgenres and plots within the romance publishing field—nonetheless there are significant similarities across these categories as well. The basic plotline of the romance narrative holds true despite subgenre variation, which, as we’ll see in the case of erotica and paranormal, can serve simply to highlight the core genre message. As such, likening readers and novels and considering the phenomenon of romance narrative as a whole allows important insights to emerge. More specifically, in this article, I argue romance novels are so popular partly because they do deep and complicated work for the (mostly) women who read them—work that derives from the mythic or religious nature of the romance narrative that serves to engage readers in a “reparation fantasy” of healing in regards to male-female relations. Romance novels help women readers, especially heterosexual women, deal with their essentially paradoxical relationship toward men within a culture still marked by patriarchy and its component threat of violence toward women.[2]Most baldly put, this paradox has women in a position of simultaneously desiring and fearing men. Romance novels function as an antidote, as a way of pleasurably working through—in fantasy, in the safe and imaginative play world of fiction—the contradictory position of the heterosexual woman within patriarchal rape culture. This complex work, we will see, involves reconciling women to the limits and threats specifically posed to them as women by the culture, yet also teaching women to refuse to accept such limits and threats as normative and empowering them to expect or demand better for themselves. Furthermore, I argue that the industry subcategories of erotica (including gay/lesbian and “slash” romance) and paranormal—both areas of strong recent growth within the overall genre—offer new and highly effective literary means for women to use romance fiction as a way of working out their position within the culture. Indeed, the mainstream growth of erotica in particular signals important changes in American cultural attitudes towards women’s sexuality and perhaps, finally, a loosening of the patriarchal knot of allowable sexual expression.This article forms the initial part of an ongoing monograph project on the romance narrative in popular culture, focusing especially on popular romance fiction. I seek to understand how this romance narrative functions and how it is currently changing, both as a genre of popular literature and as a form of human relationship. Unlike some lines of previous academic inquiry into romance fiction, my goal has little to do with either critique or defense of the genre, nor do I aim for close literary reading of individual authors (e.g., Radway 1991, Coddington 1997, Regis 2003, Goade 2007). Like Tania Modleski, I seek to read “symptomatically” (2008, xix), not intending by this metaphor for romance fiction to be taken as illness or pathology, but simply as a rich cultural site that yields much insight into critical issues of gender and sexuality in America today. I seek to place romance fiction in the broader context of the romance narrative in popular culture; and to adopt a framework of cultural studies, religious studies, gender studies, and sex-positive feminist theory to ask questions about meaning, fantasy, fear, and desire in how the romance narrative plays out in the realms of both popular and high culture in which this story holds such vast sway.<br /><br />

                        CINDERELLA<br /><br /><p>One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with a
 wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very
 bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s 
palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her 
stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, 
they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the 
party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she 
did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a
 party and left Cinderella alone at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy 
godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball 
now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a
 dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be 
worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into 
the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy 
godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly 
Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and 
said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother
 then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden
 four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy 
Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, 
because this magic will works only until midnight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her 
beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so 
different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass 
slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He 
met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I 
want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night 
and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother 
warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last 
moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and 
went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass 
slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the 
clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous 
shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress 
anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked 
about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very 
curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in 
love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even 
did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he 
said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into 
this glass slipper!”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the 
existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the 
size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper 
but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her 
stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let 
her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect 
leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced 
that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married 
Cinderella and they lived happily.</p><br /><br /><br />

                        Sangkuriang<br /><p>Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p>They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p>Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />

He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />
