A concert theater has capacity of 100 seats. It's split of Block A (50 seats) and Block B (50 seats). A
tourist group leader plans to book every seat.
Apparently, she only has 97 tourists on the group; there are three seats rest.
She is able to request a refund for one seat of Block A and one seat of Block B, and one other seat for
reserve.
So, we have 49 seats or Block A and 49 seats on Block B
However, if we sum: 49 seats + 49 seats = 98 seats + 1 reserved seat so the total is 99 seats. The total
supposed to be 100 seats.

                                            The locations of stars in the sky relative to one another do not appear to the naked eye to change, and as a result stars are often considered to be fixed in position. Many unaware stargazers falsely assume that each star has its own permanent home in the nighttime sky.In reality, though, stars are always moving, but because of the tremendous distances between stars themselves and from stars to Earth, the changes are barely perceptible here. An example of a rather fast-moving star demonstrates why this misconception prevails; it takes approximately 200 years for a relatively rapid star like Bernard's star to move a distance in the skies equal to the diameter of the earth's moon. When the apparently negligible movement of the stars is contrasted with the movement of the planets, the stars are seemingly unmoving. Artinya apa ya ?</a>

It looked sunny day with the blue sky and I felt a gentle breeze. The waves there were suitable for swimming, but unfortunately I couldn't swim. I just played with white sand and built a sand castle. I didn't forget to take a selfie with the background of beautiful beach.At noon, I began to feel hungry. I approached the rented hut. Apparently, my mother had prepared food for us. I felt happy to be able to vacation with family and enjoyed the beauty of nature created by God.tolong ubah ke ( + , - , ? )​</a>

                                            Butterflies are some of the World's most wondrous animals. Their beauty, seemingly miraculous metamorphosis, and apparently carefree flight all spark our imaginations,As advanced insects, butterflies and moths have a “complete” life cycle. This means that there are four separate stages, each of which looks completely different and serves a different purpose in the life of the insect. They are eggs, caterpillars, chrysalises, and colourful butterflies. Butterflies and moths are found on all continents except Antarctica, and scientists estimate that there are approximately 12-15,000 species of butterflies. In the United States and Canada, more than 750 species of butterflies have been recorded. Many species of a few kinds of butterflies are still being discovered.a There are still thousands of butterfly species that have not been found or described by scientists.

A concert theater has capacity of 100 seats. It's split of Block A (50 seats) and Block B (50 seats). A
tourist group leader plans to book every seat.
Apparently, she only has 97 tourists on the group; there are three seats rest.
She is able to request a refund for one seat of Block A and one seat of Block B, and one other seat for
reserve.
So, we have 49 seats or Block A and 49 seats on Block B
However, if we sum: 49 seats + 49 seats = 98 seats + 1 reserved seat so the total is 99 seats. The total
supposed to be 100 seats.
What happen?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The reserve chair is taken by the tour leader as there are 97 tourist which means 97 seats are occupied however given that there were 98 seats at the end with two reserve means that the chair that the tour leader was supposed to be in was not there.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. The locations of stars in the sky relative to one another do not appear to the naked eye to change, and as a result stars are often considered to be fixed in position. Many unaware stargazers falsely assume that each star has its own permanent home in the nighttime sky.In reality, though, stars are always moving, but because of the tremendous distances between stars themselves and from stars to Earth, the changes are barely perceptible here. An example of a rather fast-moving star demonstrates why this misconception prevails; it takes approximately 200 years for a relatively rapid star like Bernard's star to move a distance in the skies equal to the diameter of the earth's moon. When the apparently negligible movement of the stars is contrasted with the movement of the planets, the stars are seemingly unmoving. Artinya apa ya ?</h2><br />
                        Lokasi bintang di langit relatif terhadap satu sama lain tidak muncul dengan mata telanjang untuk mengubah, dan sebagai bintang akibat sering dianggap tetapdalam posisi. Banyak penikmat menyadari salah berasumsi bahwa setiap bintang memiliki rumah permanen sendiri di malam hari sky.In kenyataan, meskipun, bintang selalu bergerak, tetapi karena jarak yang besar antara bintang sendiri dan dari bintang ke bumi, perubahan tersebut nyaris tak terlihat di sini. Contoh dari bintang yang agak bergerak cepat menunjukkan mengapa kesalahpahaman ini berlaku; dibutuhkan sekitar 200 tahun untuk bintang yang relatif cepat seperti bintang Bernard untuk bergerak jauh di langit sama dengan diameter bulan bumi. Ketika gerakan tampaknya diabaikan dari bintang-bintang yang kontras dengan gerakan planet-planet, bintang-bintang yang tampaknya tak bergerak :V<br />

Their beauty, seemingly miraculous metamorphosis, and apparently carefree flight all spark our imaginations,As advanced insects, butterflies and moths have a “complete” life cycle. This means that there are four separate stages, each of which looks completely different and serves a different purpose in the life of the insect. They are eggs, caterpillars, chrysalises, and colourful butterflies. Butterflies and moths are found on all continents except Antarctica, and scientists estimate that there are approximately 12-15,000 species of butterflies. In the United States and Canada, more than 750 species of butterflies have been recorded. Many species of a few kinds of butterflies are still being discovered.a There are still thousands of butterfly species that have not been found or described by scientists. There is much to be learned.
