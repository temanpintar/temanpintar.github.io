                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

One forest in unison laughed at him in disbelief. Moreover, the rabbit who was so arrogant underestimated the ability of the turtle.</p><p>On the day of the start of the match the <strong>rabbit </strong>began to show his ability to run very fast at the beginning of the match. The turtle began to walk quietly and slowly, as if ignoring the ability and arrogance of the rabbit.</p><p>The <strong>rabbit </strong>because he felt that he had the upper hand after running a long distance, he walked leisurely, then sat under a tree.

Until finally he passed the rabbit who was asleep under a tree.</p><p>Finally the rabbit woke up and chased the turtle, but unfortunately his efforts were in vain, because the turtle had already reached the finish line and became the winner.

But the other one did not know how to climb. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place. Because the bears do not touch the dead creatures.Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend.”<br />

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers. He was ugly.<br />2.No, he did not.

                        Goose and the Golden Egg<br />Once a farmer went to the nest swan and found there was an egg, yellow and shiny. When he took it, the egg was as heavy as stone. He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby. So, when the farmer came out the next day, you know what he found in the swan's nest? Nothing.<br />Moral: People who always want more frequent sometimes lose everything. If you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you may lose what you already have.<br /><br />atau<br /><br />A Wolf and Dog<br />Once upon a time there was a wolf who nearly died of starvation. He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />

The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />
