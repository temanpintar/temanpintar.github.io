I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</a>

Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a.

Aesop's Fables The ant and the dove An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the dove, which sat in the branches. The ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the dove take wing. The moral of the story is: One good turn deserves another. The cat and the mice A certain house was overrun with mice. A cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the mice kept themselves close in their holes. The cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you." The moral of the story is: He who is once deceived is doubly cautious. The Crab and the Fox A crab, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighbouring green meadow as its feeding ground. A fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for the sea?" The moral of the story is: Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness. soal : 1. sebutkan dan tuliskan pesan moral yang ada dibacaan diatas ! ​</a>

It is an important issue because it ...(54)...fundamental moral and economic questions about the way we use our native wildlife.
It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

Aesop's Fables The ant and the dove An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the dove, which sat in the branches. The ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the dove take wing. The moral of the story is: One good turn deserves another. The cat and the mice A certain house was overrun with mice. A cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the mice kept themselves close in their holes. The cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you." The moral of the story is: He who is once deceived is doubly cautious. The Crab and the Fox A crab, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighbouring green meadow as its feeding ground. A fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for the sea?" The moral of the story is: Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness. soal : 1. sebutkan dan tuliskan pesan moral yang ada dibacaan diatas ! ​</a>

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

                            6. Yang pandai bahasa Inggris, tolong terjemahkan ini ke bhs. Indonesia ya?penting banget soalnya.
I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</h2><br />

Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. What is the main idea of the second paragraph? b. What is the main idea of the third paragraph? c. What isthe possible title for the text? Hii kaka.... Bagi yang mau jawaban fulll...

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity.

Tolong dibantu kak... jawablah pertanyaan dibawah ini ! tolong di jawab secepatnyamapel : bahasa inggrispetunjuk : sebelum menjawab kalian harus membaca bacaan tersebut .Read the story. Aesop's Fables The ant and the dove An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the dove, which sat in the branches. The ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the dove take wing. The moral of the story is: One good turn deserves another. The cat and the mice A certain house was overrun with mice. A cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the mice kept themselves close in their holes. The cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you." The moral of the story is: He who is once deceived is doubly cautious. The Crab and the Fox A crab, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighbouring green meadow as its feeding ground. A fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him up.

                            28. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The issue of whether we should allow marine parks to stay open has been widely debated in your community recently. It is an important issue because it ...(54)...fundamental moral and economic questions about the way we use our native wildlife.
It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

Aesop's Fables The ant and the dove An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the dove, which sat in the branches. The ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the dove take wing. The moral of the story is: One good turn deserves another. The cat and the mice A certain house was overrun with mice. A cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the mice kept themselves close in their holes. The cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you." The moral of the story is: He who is once deceived is doubly cautious. The Crab and the Fox A crab, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighbouring green meadow as its feeding ground. A fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for the sea?"

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast.
