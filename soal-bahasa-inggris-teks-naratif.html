                        Text “Lutung Kasarung”<br /><br />A long time ago in west Java there was a kingdom. The king was Prabu Tapak Agung. He had two beautiful daughters and no son. Purba Rarang was his first daughter, and Purba Sari was his second daughter. When the king was about to pass away he gave the throne to his second daughter, Purba Sari. Purba Rarang was very disappointed. She thought that she deserve to replace her father as the ruler. She discussed the situation with her fiancé, Indrajaya.<br /><br />Then she got an evil idea. She asked a witch to cast a spell to Purba Sari. Soon after that Purba Sari had a strange skin disease. There were black dots on her skin. She also had skin rash. Consequently Purba Rarang had a reason to tell people that her sister had a great sin and she was cursed by god. She told her people that such a person did not qualify to be a leader.<br /><br />After that she ordered the army to send Purba Sari to a wood and had her exiled there. The army then built a wooden house for Purba Sari in a wood. So Purba Sari lived in the wood. As there were many animals in the wood she got along with them well.<br /><br />Her best friend was a black monkey. She called the monkey Lutung Kasarung. Lutung was very attentive and very kind to her. He gave fruits and vegetables to Purba Sari.<br /><br />Lutung Kasarung was not an ordinary monkey. He often meditates like human being. One night when there was a full moon he sat meditating. He was praying to God. Suddenly a spring emerged beside Lutung. It became bigger and bigger and finally it became a lake. The water was very clear and aromatic.<br /><br />The next day Lutung came to see Purba Sari. He asked her to follow him. Lutung took her to the lake and asked her to take a bath. When Purba Sari took bath in the lake something strange happened. Her skin disease was gone and her smooth fair skin was back. Purba Sari was very happy and thankful to God.<br /><br />Meanwhile Purba Rarang who lived in the palace wanted to see her sister. So she went to the wood with her soldiers. She was very surprised when she saw Purba Sari was in good condition and looked beautiful. Her evil heart led her to find a way to beat her sister. Then she asked her sister to measure the length of their hair. The one who had the longest hair would win. Purba Sari’s hair proved to be longer than Purba Rarang’s.<br /><br />Purba Rarang was very jealous to her sister. She thought hard to find a way to beat Purba Sari. Then she got another idea. She asked her sister to compare their fiancé. Purba Rarang was sure that she would win because Indra Jaya was very handsome. She was sure that Purba Sari did not have any fiancé. When Purba Rarang showed Indra Jaya, Purba Sari was confused. So she just appointed Lutung Kasarung as her fiancé.<br /><br />Purba Rarang laughed out loud.<br /><br />‘So your fiancé is a monkey?’<br /><br />Lutung Kasarung then sat on the ground. He was meditating and praying to God. Then amazingly he changed into a very handsome man. Initially Lutung Kasarung was a handsome man who was punished by God and became a monkey. After some years that day he got clemency from God and he became human being again.<br /><br />Purba Rarang was very surprised. He had no choice but to accept that her sister was better than her. She asked for apology. Purba Sari gave her apology. After that they went back to palace. Purba Sari became the queen and married to Lutung Kasarung.<br />

From now on, you should arrange an annual offering ceremony on the 14th of Kesodo (the twelfth month of Tengerese calendar)”. It was Kusuma’s voice. Kusuma’s brothers and sisters held the offering ceremony every year. Instead of human being, they collected fruits, vegetables, rice, and meat to be offer to the Gods. And this has been done generation after generation until today.</p><p></p><br />

                        The Ant and the Dove<br /><br /><br />One hot day, an ant was seeking for some water. After walking around for a moment, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell unintentionally into the water.<br /><br /><br />She could have sunk if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly put off a leaf from a tree and dropped it immediately into the water near the struggling ant. Then the ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.<br /><br /><br />Not long after at that, there was a hunter nearby who was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it in this way.<br /><br /><br />Guessing what he should do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net and the dove flew away quickly from this net.<br /><br />The morality: One good turn deserves another.<br /><br /><br /><br />

One day, Anto saw a piece of bread lying on the ground and decided to bring it back to the colony to share with the other ants.</p><p></p><p>On his way back, Anto met a grasshopper who was singing and playing his violin.

beside the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her child lived. They were
 Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a lone parent because 
Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang
 had to reside hard with his mother.<br /><br />Malin Kundang was a 
wholesome, dilligent, and powerful young man. He generally went to sea 
to apprehend fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, 
or sold the apprehended fish in the village.<br /><br />One day, when Malin 
Kundang was cruising, he saw a merchant's ship which was being raided by
 a little band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his audacious 
and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so 
joyous and thanked to him. In come back the merchant asked Malin Kundang
 to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang acquiesced. He 
left his mother alone.<br /><br />numerous years subsequent, Malin Kundang 
became rich. He had a huge ship and was assisted by numerous boat crews 
loading trading goods. flawlessly he had a attractive wife too. When he 
was cruising his trading excursion, his boat set down on a beach beside a
 little town. The villagers identified him. The news ran fast in the 
village; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.<br /><br />An 
vintage woman ran to the beach to rendezvous the new wealthy merchant.

sadness of being lonesome after so long time. Unfortunately, when the 
mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and
 his boat crews denied gathering that old lonesome woman. For three 
times her mother pleaded Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at 
her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have not 
ever had a mother like you, a soiled and unattractive woman!" After that
 he organised his crews to set sail. He would depart the vintage mother 
again but in that time she was full of both unhappiness and angriness.<br /><br />Finally,
 enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a pebble if 
he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and actually set sail.<br /><br />In
 the quiet ocean, abruptly a thunderstorm came. His gigantic boat was 
destroyed and it was too late for Malin Kundang to acknowledge. He was 
hurled by the signal out of his ship. He dropped on a small isle. It was
 actually too late for him to bypass his curse. abruptly, he turned into
 a stone.<br /><br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures.
